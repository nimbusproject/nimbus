#### 2-thishost
#### 3-data
#### 4-restarts

#### 0-etchosts
#
# every identity seen is always sent to etchosts
#    arg1: IP
#    arg2: short hostname
#    arg3: FQDN

etchosts: /opt/nimbus/ctx-scripts/0-etchosts.sh


#### 1-ipandhost
#
# Directory where the scripts live that match the required role names.
# See samples for more explanation.
#
# These role scripts receive:
#    arg1: IP
#    arg2: short hostname
#    arg3: FQDN

ipandhostdir: /opt/nimbus/ctx-scripts/1-ipandhost


#### 2-thishost
#
# "thishost" scripts are called with network information known about the
# host this program is running on.
#
# Each script receives:
#    arg1: IP
#    arg2: Short local hostname
#    arg3: FQDN
#
# The names of the scripts in this directory must correspond to the interface
# that the context broker knows about, not the local interface which may not
# match.
# 
# Particular scripts may be absent.  The entire directory configuration
# may also be absent.

thishostdir: /opt/nimbus/ctx-scripts/2-thishost


#### 3-data
#
# The opaque data directory contains scripts that match provided data names.
# If data fields exist in the context, the data is written to a file and
# that file absolute path is sent as only argument to the scripts.
# The scripts are called after 'thishost' but before 'restarts'.

datadir: /opt/nimbus/ctx-scripts/3-data


#### 4-restarts
#
# The restart directory contains scripts that match provided roles.
#
# After all role information has been added via the ipandhostdir script AND
# after the "thishost" scripts have successfully run, this program will call
# the restart script for each required role it knows about (presumably to
# restart the service now that config has changed).
#
# No arguments are sent.
#
# It is OK for the required role to not have a script in this directory.

restartdir: /opt/nimbus/ctx-scripts/4-restarts


#### 5-thishostfinalize
#
# The "thishostfinalize" scripts are called with network information known
# about the host this program is running on.  It is called AFTER the restart
# scripts are successfully called.
#
# Each script receives:
#    arg1: IP
#    arg2: Short local hostname
#    arg3: FQDN
#
# The names of the scripts in this directory must correspond to the interface
# that the context broker knows about, not the local interface which may not
# match.
# 
# Particular scripts may be absent.  The entire directory configuration
# may also be absent.

thishostfinalizedir: /opt/nimbus/ctx-scripts/5-thishost-finalize


# "problem" script
# In case of problems, could call poweroff.  This script will be called after
# an attempt to notify the service of the error (that notification provides
# a log of the run to the context broker).
#
# Must be configured if "--poweroff" (-p) argument is used, will not be
# consulted if that argument is not used.
