<h2>Optional Parameters</h2>

<p>The factory service allows a client to instantiate a workspace as a
WSRF resource by using the <i>create</i> operation with workspace
<a href="metadata.html">metadata</a> and a
<a href="deployment.html">deployment</a> request.  The factory service's
WSDL can be
<a href="../examples/compact/workspace_factory_port_type_compact.wsdl">viewed
online</a>.  It references a separate
<a href="../examples/compact/workspace_types.xsd">types schema</a>.</p>

<p>You may also send optional parameters alongside the
    metadata and deployment request in the create operation.</p>

<p>Currently supported optional parameters are for pre- and post-deployment
staging requests.  These are support by
<a href="../plugins/index.html">transfer plugins</a> to the workspace service
that you may need to install separately.</p>

<h2>Staging Parameters</h2>

<p><img src="../img/optional.png" alt="optional parameters" /> </p>

<p>You may specify a stage-in or stage-out directive, or both.  The
<b>stageIn</b> request will be executed before workspace propagation and the
<b>stageOut</b> request will be executed when the TransportReady state
has been reached  (see this
explanation of the <a href="deployment.html#state">workspace state lifecycle</a>).
</p>
        

<p>Within each staging request you must supply the <b>source URL</b>, and the
<b>destination URL</b>:</p>


<p><img src="../img/transfer_request.png" alt="transfer request" /></p>

<p>
    Optionally, you may supply a <b>service endpoint URL</b> that the staging
    adapter would contact on the client's behalf.  For example, an RFT
    factory URL.  The HTTP transfer functionality does not need a service
    URL but RFT and SRM do.
</p>

<p>
    Currently in TP1.3, if using the HTTP transfer functionality, you
    may optionally specify a <b>checksum</b> and <b>checksumtype</b> (you
    must supply either zero or both of these) in order to verify the transfer
    succeeded.  Typically supported values for checksumtype are 'md5' and
    'sha1' (if the service administrator has not disabled one or the other). 
</p>

<p>
    Currently in TP1.3, if using the HTTP transfer functionality, you
    may optionally transfer a <b>compressed gzip image</b>.  This must have
    the suffix ".gz" and must actually be a gzip image (the service uses the
    Linux 'file' command to verify this).  Note that if you take advantage
    of this the destination URL must have the ".gz" suffix.  But the file
    to specify for propagation in the metadata would end up not having the
    ".gz" suffix.  This functionality can be disabled.
</p>

<p>
    Optionally, you may supply delegated credential EPRs that will be used
    for the transfer.  The <b>staging credential</b> is the credential to be
    used for contacting the specified service endpoint and the <b>transfer
    credential</b> is the credential to be used for the actual transfer.
</p>
<p>
    For example, using the RFT staging plugin, you could supply the URL to
    the RFT service endpoint, the source and destination of the file to be
    transferred, the EPR of the delegated credential to use to contact RFT
    (this must be a credential delegated to a Delegation Service colocated
    with the workspace service), and the EPR of the delegated credential that
    will tell RFT what credential to invoke the transfer under (this must
    be a credential delegated to a Delegation Service colocated with the RFT
    service).
</p>
<p>
    Very often, the credential used to access a transfer service and the
    credential used to invoke the transfers are the same ones.  To facilitate
    this common case, the sample Java
    client distributed with the workspace service includes (optional) support
    for contacting a delegation service, delegating your credential, and
    filling in the necessary elements in your transfer request.
