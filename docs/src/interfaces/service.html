<h2>Workspace Service</h2>

<p>The Workspace Service allows a client to manage and inspect a workspace
after it has been instantiated as a WSRF resource by the
<a href="factory.html">factory service</a>.  The service's
WSDL can be
<a href="../examples/compact/workspace_port_type_compact.wsdl">viewed
online</a>.  It references a separate
<a href="../examples/compact/workspace_types.xsd">types schema</a>.</p>

<p>There are two operations besides standard WSRF operations: <b>start</b>
and <b>shutdown</b>.</p>

<p>Start is used in two situations: 1) a workspace may be shutdown by a client
before it is scheduled to be and 2) a workspace resource can be created
with a <a href="deployment.html">deployment</a> request that specifies
a state other than <i>Running</i> to move the workspace to.  In both cases,
the client can "manually" start the workspace.</p>

<p>The shutdown operation can be used to halt the workspace.  It has one
parameter, a choice from an enumeration of shutdown options:
<i>Normal, Pause, Serialize, Reboot, Trash</i>, and
<i>ReadyForTransport</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>Normal</b> shutdown option sends a halt signal to the virtual
machine and waits for it shut down properly.  The Workspace Service
is configured to wait a specific time for the normal shutdown
to succeed -- after this time
the workspace service will force the removal of the virtual
machine (similar to hard powering off a physical node).  In this case,
the workspace service will mark the workspace corrupted.</p>

<p>The <b>Pause</b> shutdown option will remove the VM from the VMM's
CPU scheduler, "pausing" its execution of instructions.  It will not
however serialize the virtual machine to files (some VMMs combine
these steps).</p>

<p>The <b>Serialize</b> shutdown option will remove the VM from the VMM
entirely, serializing its current state to files. <b>Serialize is not
supported</b> in this version.</p>

<p>The <b>Reboot</b> shutdown option will send a reboot signal to the VM.</p>

<p>The <b>Trash</b> shutdown option will immediately power off the VM and
remove what partition files are only used by the VM (what the client can
remove will be policy controlled).</p>

<p>The <b>ReadyForTransport</b> shutdown option moves the workspace files
to a storage node.  In the future this step may be accompanied by other steps,
for example taking digests of workspace files and signing its metadata.
ReadyForTransport is discussed in the <a href="deployment.html">deployment</a>
page's WorkspaceState section.</p>

<p>
    There are currently two supported resource properties,
    <a href="deployment.html"><b>WorkspaceDeployment</b></a> and
    <b>logistics</b> available for inspection.  In this version, there is
    no support for client modifications of a workspace RP that propagate
    changes to the workspace - this will be included in future versions.
</p>
<p>
    The service is a NotificationProducer and the client distributed with the
    Workspace Service subscribes for notifications of changes to these
    resource properties (for example, a workspace state change can produce
    useful notifications).
