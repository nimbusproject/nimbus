<h2>Workspace Metadata</h2>

<p>A virtual workspace is an abstraction of an execution environment -- in this
VM-based service, a workspace is defined in terms of VM images and the information
necessary to instantiate them in a controlled manner.</p>

<p>The workspace metadata type contains information necessary for workspace
   deployment. This information is deployment-independent; once defined,
    a workspace may be deployed many times. </p>

<p>This section is divided into three parts:</p>
<div class="ullispace">
<ul>
    <li><a href="#vw">VirtualWorkspace</a></li>
    <li><a href="#definition">Workspace Definition</a></li>
    <li><a href="#logistics">Deployment Logistics (networking)</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<a name="vw"></a>

<h2>VirtualWorkspace</h2>

<p>A VirtualWorkspace element consists of a name, definition
section, and logistics section.</p>

<p><img alt="Virtual Workspace Type" src="../img/VirtualWorkspace02.png"/></p>

<p>You can view the VirtualWorkspace_Type definition online in the
<a href="../examples/compact/metadata/vw.xsd">vw schema</a>.  You can
also view a simple
<a href="../examples/sample-workspace.xml">sample workspace</a> that is
installed with this version of the workspace client.</p>

<p>Specifying metadata about your own VM should be as simple as taking
the sample workspace metadata file and adjusting some of the fields (see
the <a href="../doc/metadata-quickstart.html">metadata quickstart</a>).</p>

<p>The workspace <b>name</b> is a URI that could be used to obtain
information such as such as its provenance, creation and modification times,
or detailed software catalog (i.e., the <i>deployment capability</i> of
a workspace which defines what kinds of applications the workspace can
support) .  This information is not directly relevant to deployment but
would be very useful for clients.</p>


<a name="definition"></a>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<p>The definition section of the workspace description contains static
information that cannot change during deployment. This includes: (1)
requirements (kernel images or versions, kernel parameters, and required CPU
architecture), (2) references to particular image partitions, and (3) what
device names for these partition files the OS is expecting. </p>

<p>You can view the definition type online in the
<a href="../examples/compact/metadata/vw-definition.xsd">vw-definition
schema</a>.  You can also view a simple
<a href="../examples/sample-workspace.xml">sample workspace</a> that is
installed with this version of the workspace client.</p>

<p>
    The definition section consists of two sections, requirements and
    diskCollection:
</p>

<p>
    <img alt="definition overview" src="../img/definition01.png" />
</p>

<p>
    The <b>requirements</b> section lists the CPU architecture, VMM
    name and version requirements, and kernel requirements.  All of its
    elements are currently respected (but of the kernel element, currently
    only the <i>parameters</i> section).
</p>

<p>
    The workspace service does not support client specification of
    kernels until support for multiple image transfers is added.
    In this version the site should configure a <i>default kernel</i> to use
    for the VMs or supply a list of (manually cached) kernel names.
</p>

<p>
    While multiple disk partitions are supported (including on-the-fly
    creation of blankspace partitions), currently only one file may be used
    with the propagation mechanisms.  The others must be files that have
    been cached already (except for blankspace partitions which are
    created on-the-fly on the hypervisor nodes).
</p>

<p>
    There is no support for fine grain authorization policies about the
    file being used for partitions unless you configure the service to
    use the creation time authorization callout (see the
    <a href="../plugins/index.html">plugins</a> page).
</p>

<p>
    The disk location is listed as a URI and bound to a device
    name ("/dev/hda") or partition ("/dev/hda1"), for an example see the
    <a href="../examples/sample-workspace.xml">sample workspace</a>.
</p>


<a name="logistics"></a>

<h2>Deployment Logistics</h2>

<p>
    The <b>logistics</b> section of the workspace description contains
    information that is typically bound at deployment time only (late binding).
    In the current version, this is networking requirements.
    The workspace's networking settings can be the defined by the
    deployer/broker, the Workspace Service itself, or by the workspace
    service's interactions with other services coordinating networking
    settings and as such is considered to be late binding. In this version
    <b>only the factory service client can specify the logistics
    information</b>.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Note:</i> Logistics are different from values in the
    <a href="deployment.html">deployment</a> type.  They may change per
    deployment but also may persist beyond a single deployment.  Therefore they
    are tied to the defintion but are not strictly what defines the particular
    workspace. For example, if a workspace uses DHCP
    when it is booted but then it is paused and migrated, the specific
    networking information must be part of its definition in order to
    unpause it successfully on a new subnet.
</p>

<p>
    <img alt="networking" src="../img/networking.png" />
</p>

<p>
    A VM can have an arbitrary number of virtual network interfaces that
    are mapped to physical hardware in different ways.  Broadly, there
    are two types of networking configurations to manage: how the network
    interfaces inside the VM need to be configured and how these interfaces
    need to be bridged and managed outside the VM.
</p>

<p>
    The <b>name</b> of a NIC is a logical name used to refer to it, for
    example from the deployment type's bandwidth section.  The <b>MAC</b>
    address can optionally be specified (it will otherwise be generated).
</p>

<p>
    An <b>association</b> string can be configured to give more information
    that may be necessary such as a IP address pool label.  Keywords
    could be correlated with different classes
    of connectivity or different links and subnets. Alternatively it can
    be used to express inter-VM connectivity requirements.
</p>

<p>
    As a simple example, consider a physical node with two physical NICs that
    is configured with the association "public" and "private."  Each of these
    keywords map to an in-memory bridge connected to each NIC and one NIC has
    Internet access and one NIC has private LAN access.  The metadata does not
    specify the name of the physical bridge the VM needs to be bridged
    to (since that is hypervisor node specific), it maps to a <i>class of
    connectivity</i> instead.
</p>

<p>
    The <b>ipConfig</b> section specifies how the VM should be
    <i>internally</i> configured.  Just like the MAC, mode, and
    association L2, the IP settings may be decided at deploy time.
    Thus it is necessary to support a wide range of L3 options for
    the VM's NIC(s) and be able to pass this information to the VM.
</p>

<p>
    <img alt="ip config" src="../img/ipconfig.png" />
</p>

<p>
    There are three <b>acquisitionMethods</b> the NIC can use for its settings:
    AcceptAndConfigure, Advisory, and AllocateAndConfigure.
    <b>AcceptAndConfigure</b> and <b>AllocateAndConfigure</b> signal to the
    workspace service that it is responsible for configuring the VM itself
    with specific settings (so that during its boot process the virtual
    hardware is configured with the specified settings) and <b>Advisory</b>
    signals that the VM should just be configured with the appropriate hardware
    and connectivity settings (some other entity will configure the
    networking settings inside the VM).
</p>

<p>
    AcceptAndConfigure means the client must have the exact NIC configuration
    requested in the deployment request.  AllocateAndConfigure means that the
    client is requesting an address from a pool of available addresses.  See
    the text on associations above.  For more information about address pools,
    see the administrator's guide.
</p>

<p>
    This version of the workspace service supports DHCP for the
    AcceptAndConfigure and AllocateAndConfigure acquisition
    methods, both require getting specific settings "into" the workspace
    dynamically. The workspace backend program employs DHCP which will
    intercept DHCP requests comding from the VM's networking interfaces and
    assign a specific setting to it.  Note that this includes assigning
    specific, client requested IP addresses (DHCP can be made to have specific
    responses to a request).  For more information on setting up DHCP and how
    it is implemented in such a way that does not interfere with a site's DHCP
    server, see the administrator's guide.
