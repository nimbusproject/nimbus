<h3>2.5RC1</h3>

<i>Summary</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            We are happy to announce the first version of Cumulus!
        </p>
        <p>
            Cumulus is storage cloud implementation: it allows remote users to store objects on a storage cloud.  Cumulus is compatible with the Amazon Web Services S3 REST API (with small exceptions) and it works seamlessy with clients such as s3cmd and boto. In addition, it also offers extra functionality, specifically  disk quota enforcement.  Cumulus replaces the current GridFTP-based upload and download of VM images: it integrates tightly in a Nimbus installation as the VM image repository solution. It can be also installed on its own to manage a storage cloud.
        </p>
        <p>
            Read more below in the Cumulus section of the changelog.
        </p>

        <p>
            Zero To Cloud installation process
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides being the first Cumulus release, the other major event of 2.5 is the first release of the "Zero To Cloud" installation process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the changes in this release work together with the goal of providing a seamless installation process.  Read more below about each new feature, highlights include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A new user management system: users can be added and managed quickly.  By default, their credentials are created on the fly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tight user integration with Cumulus: user management includes user setup with the image repository as well as the IaaS services.
            </li>
            <li>
                No unix account separation or root needed for Cumulus -- installation is easier because the IaaS central services and Cumulus can live in the same, non-root unix account.
            </li>
            <li>
                The IaaS service is able to consult information in a database about files the remote user wants to launch.  When the "outside" namespace of the file is Cumulus based, there is a translation to an "inside" path.  This mechanism is now used to encapsulate propagation mechanisms, allowing for an easy way to introduce new propagation methods. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            All of this combined to allow us to, among other things, build a new installation program for Nimbus.  You can now tend to the central service node installation separately and very quickly.  Further, you install in a "fake" mode that doesn't actually invoke hypervisor machines yet.  Doing all of this allows you to know that this part of the equation is configured and works (including security).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            New scheduling options.  The VMM selection process can now be driven by configuration:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. A "round-robin" configuration that looks for matching nodes (enough space to run, appropriate network support, etc.) with the highest percentage of free space.  If there are many equally free nodes it will pick randomly from those.  As should be clear, this favors entirely empty nodes first.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. A "greedy" configuration that looks for matching nodes (enough space to run, appropriate network support, etc.) with the lowest percentage of free space.  If there are  many "equally unfree" nodes, it will pick randomly from those.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Integration with a central, site DHCPd
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of hosting a private DHPCd for each VMM, Nimbus now supports (by default) editing a lease file for a central DHCPd on the LAN. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This makes it easier for many to integrate with existing infrastructure.  You will configure the DHCP server to respond to specific MAC addresses with specific IP addresses.  Each time you change your network pool in Nimbus, you must update the DHCPd at the same time with the new information.
        </p>
        <p>
            The old way is still supported as an advanced configuration.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            New alternative propagation methods
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two new contributed propagation drivers: HTTP and HDFS.  These are for use outside of the cloud client currently, you need to configure Nimbus to allow for non-Cumulus-based image locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are for use on sites where the remote user knows more about image locations than the Cumulus name for it.  The HTTP driver is also good for having a central image repository (you can specify trusted hosts to pull from).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Better performing blankspace: physical partition leases
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to support  very large temporary space partitions for VMs, and fast access to them,  allow the administrator to configure a list of physical partitions to lease out to incoming Nimbus VMs on each node (formatted for each use).
        </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <p>
            Support for user-requested number of cores.
        </p>
        <p>
            This contributed feature allows remote users to specify the number of cores the VM(s) should have.  The authorization policies now support this as well, allowing administrators to specify the maximum allowed for each user/group.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            New service node dependency requirements, see the Cumulus section for specifics.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Bug fixes, see each section below for specifics.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            For developers: highlights include a new internal testing framework for the RM API and tight integration with IntelliJ IDEA if you use that IDE. 
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

        <p>
            We are happy to announce the first version of the new Nimbus installer.
        </p>
        <p>
            It helps make useful initial configurations, eliminates the
            need for a separate Globus container installation, and sets up an
            embedded certificate authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            The installer also introduces the important new concept of "NIMBUS_HOME" on the services node.
        </p>

    <li>
        <p>
            GridFTP will now work with the Nimbus auto-certificate-authority
            technology because a revocation file is now added when the CA is created.  See

        <p>
                    
        The Nimbus Monitoring &amp; Discovery system has received a substantial overhaul since its first incarnation. The system still utilizes custom Nagios plugins to report worker node and head node resources. However, the Globus 4.x MDS utility is no longer used as the data registry. Instead, the system publishes XML to files to be served up by a web browser. A new utility, <a href="http://github.com/hep-gc/cloud-aggregator">Cloud Aggregator</a> has been developed separately to query these XML sources.

    <li>
        <p>
            Refactored workspace-control and integrated with

<i>Services</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Support for the EC2 Query API.  Tested with the Python
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/boto/">boto</a> client but should
            work with others. The service does not run in the standard Globus container,
            it spawns a separate Jetty process. While installed by default, it requires
            configuration before it can be used.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            EC2 SOAP API support has been upgraded to version 2009-08-15. This means
            ec2-api-tools clients must be upgraded to
            <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads/ec2-api-tools-1.3-42584.zip">
            this version</a>. Early work has been done to support multiple versions
            concurrently, but this functionality is not yet available.

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The new Nimbus web portal is based on Django and is a standalone
            component with (in this version) no ties to the other Nimbus services. This
            component's current sole functionality to facilitate securely
            providing users with their X509 and query credentials.  It will be expanded in future releases to include more functionality for both users and administrators.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The Context Broker has been refactored and merged into the main Nimbus
            source tree. It is installed by default but is not enabled because it
            needs configuration.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The Nimbus Derby configuration now supports network access, though it
            is disabled by default. At install, passwords are generated and stored
            in <i>var/derby.properties</i>. The Nimbus service still uses the
            embedded interface. See

            Introduction of a standalone context broker, see the downloads
            page.  This runs by itself so that you can use just the context
            broker to contextualize virtual clusters on EC2.  No Nimbus cluster
            is necessary.

<i>Cloud client</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Current cloud client as of this release is cloud-client-011.  This
            supports contextualization using the new standalone context broker.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            A lone invocation of "--status" (which prints all your currently
            running instances) will now print the associated cloud handle
            of each workspace.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Java 1.5 (Java 5) is now a requirement
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The TP2.2 service side is backwards compatible with the "old
            style" contextualization but this cloud client only supports
            the new one.  <i>You can only use this against Nimbus TP2.1
            installations if you are not using contextualization</i>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Support for contextualizing easily with EC2 resources.  See the
            output of "--extrahelp" for the new "--ec2script" option.  Sample
            EC2 cluster.xml file is @ "samples/ec2basecluster.xml"
        </p>
        <p>
            This will take care of the context broker interactions for you and
            give you a suggested set of EC2 commands to run (including files
            for metadata) for the virtual cluster to contextualize while running
            on EC2.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Fixed bug in the "lib/this-globus-environment.sh" script, the
            X509_CERT_DIR variable was being set incorrectly
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<i>Context agent</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            A new version of the context agent is necessary to contextualize a
            virtual cluster with Nimbus TP2.2's metadata server and the new
            context broker.

                    One is the normal implementation where the
                    server-side generates a private and public key (using
                    <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/">jsch</a>) and delivers
                    the private key to you.

            <li>

                <p>
                    The other (configured by default) is a break from the
                    regular semantics.  It allows the keypair "name" you
                    send in the request to be the name AND the public key value.
                    This means there is never a private key server-side and
                    also that you can keys you aready have on your system.

            If you are familiar with a previous Nimbus versions (VWS), these

            which you don't need to look at anymore.
            The files hold name=value pairs with surrounding comments.  They
            are organized by area: accounting.conf, global-policies.conf,
            logging.conf, pilot.conf, network.conf, ssh.conf, vmm.conf.

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Support for storing images at the repository in gzip format and
            retrieving them from the repository in gzip format.  This can
            save a lot of time in cluster situations.

    <li>
        <p>
            Various client enhancements including internal organization,
            cleaner output, and new commandline options.  Embedded security

    <li>
        <p>
            No configuration migrations are necessary for moving to this
            version from TP1.3.2.  Some configuration additions will be
            necessary if you'd like to take advantage of features.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            There was a WSDL update: additions, changes and new namespaces.

            New ensemble service report operation allows efficient queries

            Fixed bug where IP address updates were not passing through cache
            layer to DB correctly causing a possible inconsistency if container
            restarted in certain circumstances. <b>NOTE:</b> <i>this bugfix
            was not present in TP1.3.3 but is present in TP1.3.3.1</i>.

    <li>
        <p>
            No configuration changes are necessary for moving to this version
            from TP1.3.2.  But to enable the context broker, you need to
            configure paths to a credential for it in the jndi-config file
            and make sure the WSDD file lists the context broker as in the
            source file "deploy-server.wsdd" (which becomes server-config.wsdd)
        </p>

            Added cloud-client cluster and contextualization support.  Includes
            new "--cluster" flag (see cloud-client CHANGES.txt for full changes
            there).
        </p>
        <p>
            See the <a href="clouds/">clouds page</a> and the new

    </li>
</ul>


<i>Workspace-control</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Support for gzip via filename-sense.  See cloud
            <a href="clouds/clusters.html#compression">notes</a> on image
            compression/decompression.  This can save a lot of time in cluster
            launch situations since the gzip/gunzip happens on the VMMs
            simultaneously, cutting transfer times (where there is contention)
            considerably.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Local-locked the control of dhcpd start and stop: now works for
            situations where multiple workspaces are deployed on a VMM
            simultaneously (such as one VM per core and launching as part of
            a cluster).  The DHCP adjustment was being excercised
            simultaneously, revealing the race.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            There is no need to change the workspace-control configuration
            file from a TP1.3.2 compatible one.  There is a new configuration
            if you want to use it, though.  The "[behavior] --> num_cpu_per_vm"
            configuration allows you to peg the number of vcpus that are
            assigned to every workspace.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can choose to not upgrade workspace-control at all if you don't
            want the features listed here.

            Clients may now send customization tasks with request, files on the
            image will be replaced with the content.  The cloud client, for
            example, is set up by default to send a customization request that
            sets up the workspace's "/root/.ssh/authorized_keys" file.

    <li>
        <p>
            Clients can request an alternate unpropagation target to save a

            See the <a href="doc/cloud.html">Cloud Guide</a> for an overview
            of a new set of configurations/conventions that allow for clients
            to get up and running in minutes even from laptops on NATs.

            Centralized MAC address allocations to the workspace service.  This

        <p>
            There is a new configuration in the <i>jndi-config.xml</i> file that
            allows the administrator to define the valid prefix for MAC
            address selection.  See <i>WorkspaceFactoryService</i> ->
            <i>NetworkAdapter</i> -> <i>macPrefix</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once an IP is assigned a MAC address (during service initialization)
            it remains with that IP as long as it is configured as part of the
            network pools.  This ensures that local network devices can cache
            MAC/IP bindings without needing to be manually cleared (no need for
            unsolicited ARP reply to guarantee connectivity).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Introduction of the "groupauthz" plugin.  This comes directly with
            the workspace service (no separate plugin installation is
            necessary) but it is not enabled by default.  This authorization
            plugin supports different policies for different group members
            which you organize by inserting identities into different group
            files.
        </p>
        <p>
            The plugin can enforce the following policies.  The request data
            to check is determined on a per-request, per-client basis.
            The <b>limits</b> are defined on a per group basis (every caller
            identity must be a part of a group).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Maximum currently reserved minutes at one point in time.  If the
                caller has two other workspaces with 10 hours scheduled for each,
                the value being checked against this policy would be 20 hours
                plus whatever time the current request is.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maximum elapsed and currently reserved minutes at one point in
                time.  If the caller has one other workspace with 10 hours
                scheduled and 80 hours of recorded past usage, the value being
                checked against this policy would be 90 hours plus whatever time
                the current request is.  This is the all-time maximum usage cap.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maximum number of running workspaces at one point in time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maximum number of workspaces per request (the largest group
                request possible).
            </li>
            <li>
                The image node that must be specified.
            </li>
            <li>
                The image node base directory that must be specified.
            </li>
            <li>
                Support for identity-hash based image subdirectories
                (see the cloud setup documentation to understand this
                convention).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each policy can be set to disabled/infinite for specific groups

    <li>
        <p>
            Arbitrary file customization tasks may be sent with the workspace
            creation request.  The image is mounted on the VMM and the contents
            of the task are placed into the specified file.
        </p>
        <p>
            This requires <i>mount-alter.sh</i> support on the backend which
            expects the <i>mount -o loop</i> construct to work without specific
            filesystem selection.  i.e., this will not support workspaces with
            filesystems that the VMM kernels do not support.

        <p>
            Inclusion of alternate unpropagation URL.  This allows the client
            to specify the target URL for where the workspace is unpropagated.
            It can be specified as part of the creation request or overriden
            after deployment.  If the default shutdown mechanism was to destroy
            the workspace, this can still be used (with shutdown-save) to cause
            unpropagation to the given URL.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Authorization enhancement to support late-specified alternate
            unpropagation URL.  An operation to check the contents of a
            post-deployment alternate propagation URL request was added to the
            authorization callout interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            This can be used to filter out invalid requests.  For
            example, the groupauthz plugin discussed above will use the same
            logic here for image repository policy checking that it does at
            create time.  Previously, the authorization callout had only one
            operation which was called at creation time only.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Fault information can now be stored as part of the Corrupted state
            (for both RP queries and asynchronous state notifications).  This
            will help the remote client debug issues that can arise after a
            successful factory creation, such as "the file you specified to
            propagate does not exist at the image repository" etc.

<i>Reference clients</i>

        <p>
            Introduction of cloud-client system.  This consists of a wrapper
            program run from a specific directory setup that contains an
            embedded globus client installation among other things.
        </p>
        <p>
            For more information on the client and setting up a configuration
            to support it, see the <a href="doc/cloud.html">Cloud Guide</a>.
            To see some examples of end-user commands, see the
            <a href="clouds/">clouds</a> page.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The main client's help system was reorganized.  For help on options
            that are specific to an action, use "--help --<i>&lt;name of
            action&gt;</i>".  See the main "--help" output to get started.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The main client has a new "--exit-state" option that causes
            modes with subscriptions (in either poll or async mode) to wait
            for the specified state before exiting with success.  If the
            workspace moves to a terminal state (Corrupted etc.) then this
            is considered an error.  This is aimed at making scripts that
            wrap the client more effective.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The main client has a new "--save-target" option whose argument is
            an override to any previous unpropagation URL.  You can use this
            before or after deployment has succeeded (although it could fail
            because of authorization issues).  See the client's
            "-h --shutdown-save" output for more information.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Arbitrary customization tasks are possible by defining them in an
            optional parameters file.  But the main client now also includes a
            shortcut for the very common task of inserting your SSH public key
            as the desired contents of the <i>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</i>
            file on the VM.  See the client's "-h --deploy" output for more
            information on this new "--sshfile" option.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Support for post-deployment error printing (faults can now be
            included as part of Corrupted notifications).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Status client allows for a bulk query ("in one remote operation,
            show me a short update of all workspaces I manage at this service").
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Introduction of a base client API which abstracts operations out
            from the webservices implementation and provides common subscription
            tools, utility methods, etc.  (the main workspace client was
            internally reorganized to use this API: if you are a client
            developer you could examine this code for a lot of concrete usage
            samples).
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>


<i>Workspace-control</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            (re-)inclusion of mount-alter for file customization tasks.  Using
            this requires an additional sudo rule.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Fix for a bug where certain NIC bridging problems with a workspace
            that had more than one NIC would not trip a backout.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Fix for a bug where the lack of a gateway specification would cause
            a problem when inserting a workspace's DHCP policy.  Lack of a
            default gateway is legal (and sometimes necessary).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            When DHCP configuration file cannot be found, a more helpful error
            is printed.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Files on VMM were not being deleted in one unpropagate situation
            where they should have been.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The VM name prefix sent to the VMM has been shortened from
            "workspace" to "wrksp".  String length limits for NIC names were
            being reached too early ("wrksp" should accomodate workspace IDs in
            the millions).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            We are including a "foreign-subnet" script that allows VMMs to
            deliver IP information over DHCP to workspaces even if the VMM
            itself does not have a presence on the target IP's subnet.  This
            is an advanced configuration, you should read through the script's
            leading comments and make sure to clear up any questions before
            using.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is particularly useful for hosting workspaces with public IPs
            where the VMMs themselves do not have public IPs.  This is because
            it does not require a unique interface alias for each VMM (public
            IPs are often scarce resources).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added support for booting hard disk images (pygrub).  Resolves
            enhancement request
            <a href="http://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=5423">#5423</a>.
            Client must specify mountpoint like "hda" instead of "hda1" for
            this to trigger.

<i>Workspace pilot program</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            In some situations the sleep() system call that the pilot makes
            during an unexpected backout situation was returning too early.
            This syscall been replaced by an alternate implementation that will
            not fail in those situations.

<h3>TP1.3.1</h3>

<i>Summary</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added support for workspace pilot resource management.  The pilot
            is a program the service will submit to a local site resource
            manager in order to obtain time on the VMM nodes.  When not
            allocated to the workspace service, these nodes will be used for
            jobs as normal (the jobs run in normal system accounts in Xen
            domain 0 with no guest VMs running).  See below.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added functionality to ensure multiple workspaces (including groups
            of workspaces) are co-scheduled.  See below.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Various client enhancements including ensemble service support,
            cleaner output, and new commandline options.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Various bug fixes.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            There was a WSDL update: additions, changes and new namespaces.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<i>Services</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added support for workspace pilot resource management.  The pilot
            is a program the service will submit to a local site resource
            manager in order to obtain time on the VMM nodes.  When not
            allocated to the workspace service, these nodes will be used for
            jobs as normal (the jobs run in normal system accounts in Xen
            domain 0 with no guest VMs running).
        </p>
        <p>
            Several extra safeguards have been added to make sure the node is
            returned from VM hosting mode at the proper time, including support
            for:
            <ul>
                <li>the workspace service being down or malfunctioning</li>
                <li>LRM preemption (including deliberate LRM job cancellation)</li>
                <li>node reboot/shutdown</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Also included is a one-command "kill 9" facility for administrators
            as a "worst case scenario" contingency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the pilot is optional.  By default the service does not
            operate with it, the service instead directly manages the nodes it
            is configured to manage.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added functionality to ensure multiple workspaces (including groups
            of workspaces) are co-scheduled.  This includes the introduction
            of the Workspace Ensemble Service.  This functionality allows
            complex virtual clusters to have all its component workspaces be
            scheduled to run at once if that is necessary.  This works with
            both the default and pilot-based resource managers.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            All remote interfaces (WSDLs/schemas) have been updated with at
            least new namespaces.  You can examine them directly online at the
            WSDL and XSD files page
            (or read the descriptions on the
            Interfaces section).  The main
            difference is an extension to the factory create/deploy operation
            and the addition of the ensemble service.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            SSH based workspace-control invocations may now be configured
            with an alternate private key.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            SSH based workspace-control invocations now use options to ensure
            easier identification of misconfigurations (no password entry
            hang is possible now).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If using the pilot mechanisms, a new configuration section in the
            service configuration file needs to be uncommented for pilot
            specific configurations (see the configuration comments there).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If using the pilot mechanisms, a client may now not submit a flag
            to the factory that requests the workspace be unpropagated after
            the running time has elapsed.  Instead, unpropagation must be
            triggered manually by a client before this deadline is reached.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If using the pilot mechanisms, a shared secret must be configured
            in <i>etc/workspace_service/pilot/users.properties</i> for HTTP
            digest access authentication based notifications from the pilot.
            Use the included <i>shared-secret-suggestion.py</i> script.
            (alternatively SSH may be used for notifications but it is slower)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            New dependencies (these are distributed with the service):
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i><a href="http://backport-jsr166.sourceforge.net/">backport-util-concurrent</a></i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i><a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/">jetty</a></i>
                    - only necessary if using the pilot with the faster, default
                    HTTP digest access authentication based notifications.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Some platforms+JVMs have buffer size issues which caused some
            workspace-control invocations to fail.  This problem is addressed.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            DHCP based network delivery to the VMs now requires unique
            hostnames for each allocatable address (even if they do not
            resolve to an IP).  This addresses
            <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5738">Bug #5738</a>.

<i>Reference clients</i>
<ul>

        <p>
            A new client <i>workspace-ensemble</i> allows you to destroy
            all workspaces in a running ensemble as well as trigger the workspaces
            in the ensemble to be co-scheduled and (afterwards) allowed to
            launch.  This trigger is also available in the last workspace
            deployment of the ensemble, if desirable (this will save a web
            services operation).
        </p>
    </li>

        <p>
            Enhancement
            <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5795">Bug #5795</a>
            is addressed, this allows an early unpropagate request to be sent.
            The new <i>workspace</i> action is "--shutdown-save" and requires
            a single or group workspace EPR.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <i>workspace</i> program includes a new flag
            "--trash-at-shutdown" which allows callers to include a request
            that the service simply discards the VM after use (instead
            of unpropagating it).  This is typical behavior for virtual cluster
            compute nodes, for example.  The functionality itself is not
            new in this release, just this flag.  It allows you to include
            the flag when using commandline based resource requests as
            well as <i>override</i> a given resource request file with a
            trash-at-shutdown flag.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <i>workspace</i> program has improved output,
            especially in the cases where you are launching groups and
            ensembles.

        <p>
            Note: a previously used TP1.2.3 or TP1.3 configuration file for
            workspace-control will still work because of the nature of these
            changes.  See

            All remote interfaces, WSDLs/schemas, have been updated and also
            have new namespaces.  You can examine them directly online at the
            <a href="examples/compact/index.html">WSDL and XSD files</a> page
            (or read the descriptions on the
            <a href="interfaces/index.html">Interfaces</a> section).

            The <a href="interfaces/factory.html">Workspace Factory Service</a>
            was extended to support starting a homogenous group of workspaces
            in one deployment request.  A global maximum group size can be
            specified natively (without needing to use an authorization
            callout).

            The <a href="interfaces/groupservice.html">Workspace
            Group Service</a> was added to manage groups after deployment.
            See the <a href="interfaces/index.html#groupoverview">group

        <p>
            Hooks for accounting modules were added.  These plugins allow you
            to track clients' used or reserved running time.  There are
            separate reader and writer interfaces for flexibility.  A default
            database backed implementation is provided and enabled by default.
            By default this implementation includes a periodic write to log
            files on the system (one for current reservations, another for
            major events).
            See <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=5443">Bug 5443</a>.

            Resource selection now favors VMMs not in use.  The previous
            selection process accepted the first VMM with enough memory
            which could result in a situation where e.g. two workspaces
            are running on one VMM but no workspaces are running on another.

            The toplevel build file includes many new convenience targets,

<i>Reference clients</i>

            The help system was organized, run the client with "-h" to see the

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The client can subscribe and listen to many workspaces at a time
            after deploying a group.  As this can be quite verbose for large
            groups, there are two new options to control subscription output
            verbosity.  See the "-h" text.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            There is a <i>numnodes</i> argument that will control how many
            workspaces will be requested during the create operation.  If
            there is a NodeNumber element in a given deployment request file,
            this argument will override that.  For more about group support,
            see the <a href="interfaces/index.html">Interfaces</a> section.

            Add functionality for late network binding to client and service.
            In the default case where subscriptions are desired, the client
            will notice if networking is missing and requery for it when the
            workspace(s) move to the Running state.

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            There is a new <i>workspace-status</i> client for querying
            accounting information. See

    <li>
        <p>
            The sample XML (metadata, resource request, etc) files included
            with the client have been updated and more samples have been added.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The client build now checks that the sample XML (metadata,
            resource request, etc) files validate against their respective
            schemas.  If your ant installation does not include the
            <i>xmlvalidate</i> task, these checks are skipped.

            JNDI class discovery is done differently, this may affect you if
            you have alternate implementations of any module or plugin
            interface.  A new workspace Initializable interface can be used.
            See the <i>org.globus.workspace.Locator</i> class.

<h3>TP1.2.3</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Significant documentation updates including the addition of a
            guided <a href="doc/user-index.html">User Quickstart</a>
            and the Workspace Marketplace.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added the ability to specify multiple partitions for one VM.
            There is a restriction in this version that only one partition
            file may be used with the propagation mechanisms, the other
            partitions must be cached or on a shared filesystem.
            (<a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=5216">Bug 5216</a>)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added the ability to create blank partitions on the fly if
            the client specifies to do so by sending a storage request (the
            MB of blank space needed) in the resource requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently this hardcodes the filesystem to create on the blank
            partition (the default is ext2), in the future this may be
            specifiable by the client.

            Added an HTTP transfer adapter for pre- and post-deployment

            functionality.  For more details, see the

    <li>
        <p>
            Added the ability to choose hypervisors in the resource pool
            based on what networking associations they support.  For example,
            a request may arrive for a workspace to have NICs on two
            separate networks: the pool node selection algorithm will use
            the requirement to support both of these networks in its search.

            Added support for a resource pool model that allows one grid
            service to manage a large group of VMMs, sending incoming
            workspace deployment requests to appropriate VMM nodes for
            instantiation.

    <li>
        <p>
            To support the resource pool model, managed file propagation
            support was added to move files associated with workspaces to
            and from the resource pool nodes and storage nodes.  The current
            choices are GridFTP and SCP.

            request to include a stage in and/or stage out directive.  This is
            to manage client file movement in the grid context as opposed to
            the managed, inter-site propagation functionality.

        <p>
            To support host based authorization (which include a reverse IP
            check in its algorithm), IP pool entries may now optionally include
            matching certificate and key pairs that are moved on to the VM when
            it is allocated a particular networking address.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            New functionality is supported: create-paused, reboot.  A
            choice of default shutdown method when the maximum running time
            has been reached:  normal, trashed.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Logging choices for both the grid service and workspace-control
            program have been significantly enhanced.
        </p>

    <li>
        <p>
            The VMM workspace-control program has a new installer that will
            install the executable and create all of its necessary work
            directories and will review all directory and file permissions
            for safety (and correct problems if instructed to).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The VMM workspace-control program now employs a sudo callout to
            do its privileged work.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The VMM workspace-control program has been enhanced to isolate
            user files from each other and is set up with a safe environment
            for image altering.  A new /opt/workspace hierarchy is the default
            installation option but it allows for flexible choices.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The grid service portion has been significantly improved internally
            for asynchronous event handling, scalability and the ability to
            replace more of its subsystems with alternate or improved
            implementations.

<h3>TP1.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Support for a new, "Allocate" networking method that allows the
        workspace service administrator to specify pools of IP addresses (and
        DNS information) which are then assigned to virtual machines on
        deployment.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>The resource properties have been extended to publish deployment
        information about a workspace, such as its IP address.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Workspace metadata validation has been extended to support
           requirement checking for specific architecture, hypervisor
           version, and CPU. The workspace factory advertises the supported
           qualities as a resource property; the requirement section of
           workspace metadata is checked against the supported set.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Authorization handling has been significantly extended. The
           workspace service can now accept and process VOMS credentials
           and SAML attributes (GridShib).
           Further, an authorization callout has been added to the service
           for fine grain policies. This callout can be configured to
           implementations of a simple attribute list lookup or a python
           script allowing for arbitrary authorization logic.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Support for Xen3 has been added.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>The workspace client has been extended to accomodate new
        functionality. In addition the client interface has been extended to
        enable subscribing for notifications and specifying the resource
        allocation information at command-line.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Installation has been improved -- the client now requires only a
        minimal installation (as opposed to the full service installation).</p>
    </li>
</ul>
