        </p>

        <p>
            Nimbus is a set of open source tools that together provide
            an "Infrastructure-as-a-Service" (IaaS) cloud computing
            solution.  Our mission is to evolve the infrastructure
            with emphasis on the needs of science, but many
            non-scientific use cases are supported as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nimbus allows a client to lease remote resources by deploying
            virtual machines (VMs) on those resources and configuring
            them to represent an environment desired by the user.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was formerly known as the "Virtual Workspace Service" (VWS)
            but the "workspace service" is technically just one the components
            in the software
            <a href="#nimbus-main-components">collection</a>.

        <p>
            Options aren't always a good thing, especially to start with.  The
            main way to deploy Nimbus is the cloud configuration.  This
            involves hosting a site manager service and creating an image
            repository (see the
            <a href="admin/z2c/">Zero To Cloud guide</a> for details).  You direct your new users to use the
            <a href="clouds/cloudquickstart.html">cloud client</a> which
            gets them up and running in just a few minutes.

            Nimbus itself is not hard to install, it has a script driven install
            that asks you two questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nimbus requires that some dependencies are installed first.  On the
            service node: Java, Python, and bash.  On the
            hypervisor nodes: Python, bash, ebtables, libvirt and KVM or Xen.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of these things are installable via the package management
            system of all the popular Linux distributions.

            The components are lightweight and self-contained so that they
            can be selected and composed in a variety of ways.  For example,
            using the workspace service with the pilot will enable a different
            cluster integration strategy.  You can mix and match protocol
            implementations with the "pure Java" resource management module.
        </p>

        <p>
            Writing new components should be a matter of "dropping" them
            in.  As explained in
            "<a href="#rm-api">What is the RM API</a>?", the Java side of things
            is particularly LEGO&#0174; like.
            As of Nimbus 2.3 workspace-control (the VMM component) is modularized with around 10 plugin points.
            And we are working towards modularizing
            even more and providing better implementations for various
            components.

            Any questions, suggestions, and requirements in this
            area are appreciated.

        <p>
            The Workspace service is a standalone site VM manager that different
            remote protocol frontends can invoke.
        </p>

        <p>
            The current supported protocols are Web Services based or HTTP based.  They all run in either an <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">Apache Axis</a>
            based Java container or <a href="http://cxf.apache.org/">Apache CXF</a>.  But there is only a certain level of necessity:

                    There is nothing specific to web services based remote protocols
                    in the workspace service implementation, the messaging system
                    just needs to be able to speak to Java based libraries.

                    Workspace service dependencies have nothing to do with what
                    container it is running in, they are normal Java application

        <p>
            The metadata server responds to HTTP queries from VMs, using the same path names
			as the <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html?AESDG-chapter-instancedata.html">EC2 metadata server</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			The URL for this is obtained by looking at '<i>/var/nimbus-metadata-server-url</i>'
			on the VM, which is an optional customization task injected by the Nimbus service
			on your behalf (we are considering trying to simulate Amazon's hardcoded IP address
			"169.254.169.254" on any subnet, feedback on this idea is appreciated).
		</p>
		<p>
			Like on EC2, its responses are based on the source IP address from the TCP packet,
			giving the information specific to each VM instance.  This also means there is an
			assumption that the immediately local network is non-spoofable.  Administrators,
			you should also put in place a firewall rule that restricts this port to the VMs
			only, just in case.
		</p>
		<p>
			The metadata server is disabled by default, consult your administrator (or try
			a query from inside your VM).
		</p>
		<p>
			Administrators, see "services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/metadata.conf" for
			the details.

            The reference client exposes all features of the <a href="#wsrf-frontend">WSRF

        <p>
            Internally, it's implemented around a base Java client API suitable
            for portal integration or any programmatic usage.  Docs
            on this API are forthcoming but if you are interested check out
            <i>org.globus.workspace.client_core</i> in the client source tree

        </p>

        <p>
            The pilot is a program the service will submit to a local site
            resource manager (LRM) in order to obtain time on the VMM nodes. When
            not allocated to the workspace service, these nodes will be used
            for jobs as normal (the jobs run in normal system accounts in Xen
            domain 0 with no guest VMs running).
        </p>

        <p>
            Several extra safeguards have been added to make sure the node is
            returned from VM hosting mode at the proper time, including
            support for:

        <p>
            Using the pilot is optional. By default the service does not
            operate with it, the service instead directly manages the nodes

            Most things having to do with the Java server side components are
            very flexible, featuring an extensibility system that allows for
            customization and replacement at runtime of various behaviors.
            By employing the
            <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a>
            framework's "Dependency Injection" system, the Java components are
            virtually like LEGO&#0174; blocks.

        <p>
            One of the very strong internal interfaces here is the site resource
            management module which allows the remote security and protocol
            implementations and semantics to be separate from one consistent
            set of management operations.  The implementing module governs how
            and when callers get VMs, it assigns resources to use, and takes
            them away at the appropriate times, etc.

            Used to deploy "one-click" virtual clusters that function right
            after launch as opposed to launching a set of "unconnected"
            virtual machines like most VM-on-demand services give you.
            It also provides a facility to "personalize" VMs (seed them with
            secrets, access policies, and just-in-time configurations).
            This requires that the VMs run a lightweight script at boot time
            called the <a href="#ctxagent">Context Agent</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a user-oriented system that runs as an "overlay" on top of
            the normal VM-on-demand mechanics.  It's been used on top of Nimbus
            clouds as well as with EC2 resources.

            concerning the cluster from the context broker and then causes

        <p>
No.  Nimbus version 2.5 and higher is packaged with Cumulus and so Nimbus
is intimately
aware of Cumulus.  Nimbus must be installed with the version of Cumulus with
which it is packages.

        <p>
No.  While Cumulus is the primary interface for transfer
images in and out of the cloud, it is not the mechanism by which images
are propagated from the repository to the virtual machine monitors.
Propagation is done in a variety of different ways, many of which we
are still developing and researching in order to find the best solution

        <p>
The reliability of Cumulus depends entirely on the storage system that is backing it. In order to achieve S3 levels of reliability you need S3 levels of hardware investment but with our system even small providers can still be S3 protocol compliant while making an independent choice on cost/reliability.
