Cumulus Integration
===================

This document contains information on the changes to the Nimbus service 
and the cloud-client program that were needed in order to integrate 
Cumulus system.  The goal is to give Nimbus developers insight into how 
the system works.  The intended audience is not Nimbus users but Nimbus 
developers.

Cumulus
=======

Cumulus is an S3 REST API look-a-like.  It was written to be protocol 
compliant and semantically equivalent with the REST API documented here:

http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/APIRest.html

Absent features
---------------

The following features of S3 are absent in cumulus:

- Versioning
- Location
- Logging
- Object POST
- Object COPY
- torrent

Dependencies
------------

Cumulus was implemented in python on top of the twisted.web framework. 
The internally created library pynimbusauthz is used for handling the 
ACL features of S3.  At the moment pynimbusauthz uses sqlite, but it 
should be trivially ported to any other database.

- python 2.5 or greater
- twisted.web
- boto 
- sqlite3

Due to known bugs and security complications, internal modifications to 
twisted.web had to be made.  More information about these modifications 
can be found here:

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/288

Security Plug In
----------------

Cumulus has a plug in interface for security implementations.  Two plug 
ins were created, one using text files and another using pynimbusauthz 
(and thus using sqlite).  The text file plug in is already out of date.  
It could be brought up to date easily but at this point we expect the 
only security plugin to ever be used will be the pynimbusauthz one.  
This paragraph is only here just in the off chance that some developer 
from the future has a need for a new security interface.  If you are 
that future developer, rest assured, there is a decent abstraction to 
ACL and security management in cumulus.

Backend Plug In
---------------

Currently there is only one backend plugin written, but we expect others 
in the future.  The backend plugin is responsible for handling the 
actual storage of data.  The rest of cumulus handles marshalling the 
REST API wire protocol, authenticating users, managing bucket/object 
namespaces and mapping, etc.  The backend plug in is specifically 
responsible for being a source and sink of data.  The interface for the 
backend plugin can be seen in the file cbBackendInterface.py.  There are 
two objects in the file, a DataObject and a BucketInterface.  The Bucket 
interface is primarily a factory for DataObjects, but it also handles 
tasks like getting DataObject sizes and modification times, and deleting 
DataObject.  The DataObject is a file-like object.  The optional 
file-like methods are doc-ed out in the interface file.

The reference implementation for the backend plugin is called 
cbPosixBackend.py.  This plugin simply uses a filesystem as a DataStore. 
Other plug-ins that we expect to create in the near future are Cassandra 
and HDFS.

cloud-client
============

The cloud client has been re-organized such that it now has Repository 
modules.  The interface to these modules is defined in the file 
RepositoryInterface.java.  The code needed to do the legacy GridFTP 
protocol was pulled out and put into the file 
GridFTPRepositoryUtil.java. The remainder of the code was re-factored so 
that calls were made into that file at the appropriate time.

[ note: One area to note here is the use of getDerivedImageURL().  This 
method is called into by 
org/globus/workspace/cloud/meta/client/Cloud.java and in such a way that 
configuration options need to be inflated awkwardly (see line 205). ]

A Cumulus repository interface was also created.  The interface provides 
equivalent semantics to the previous GridFTP based implementation. When 
a user lists VMs, they see only their VMs as read/write and they see 
site common VMs as read only.  No other VMs are listed.  Cumulus itself 
does have rich file sharing capabilities, but these features are not yet 
exposed to the cloud client user.

Currently the Cumulus repository interface picks up the following 
information form the conf/cloud.properties file.

- vws.repository.s3id
    The users S3 ID.  This ID must be associated with the users x509 cert 
    in the authz database.

- vws.repository.s3key
    The users S3 secret key.

- vws.repository.s3bucket
    The site specific bucket name where all VM images (that will show 
    up in a listing) are kept.

- vws.repository.s3basekey
    A prefix for the VM image name.  This is just an organizational 
    tool for the site admin.

When cloud client transfers an image into the system with the cumulus 
repo utility (which is now the default), it forms the following url:

    cumulus://<vws.repository.s3bucket>/<vws.repository.s3basekey><vws.repository.s3id>/<NAME>

When the user does a listing, only images with the following form are 
listed:

    cumulus://<vws.repository.s3bucket>/<vws.repository.s3basekey>

And from there only those with the specific user id or the string 
'Common' will be listed.  Similar urls are formed when the user --run(s) 
a VM.

It should be noted that this is just cloud client convention to provide 
the user of the cloud client with a convenient experience.  There is 
nothing in the Nimbus service that prevents a user from uploading a VM 
to any cumulus location and then specifying that location as run point.

Dependencies
-----------

- jets3t-0.7.3.jar
- commons-httpclient-3.1.jar
- commons-codec-1.3.jar

Nimbus service
==============

The main change to the nimbus service involved adding the concept of a 
namespace translator.  The user supplies Nimbus with a external cumulus 
(and in the future potentially other) URL.  This is the location of the 
VM according to the users external namespace.  When the service receives 
this URL it can translate it into an internal location more suitable for 
propagation.

The cumulus authorization database is directly tied to the Nimbus 
service. The service has intimate knowledge of it, and it is allowed to 
manipulate it directly without going through the cumulus REST interface.  
This comes with some inherent dangers, ie: the service MUST manipulate 
it properly. Any incorrect behavior could cause internal and undefined 
failures in cumulus.  While this design choice is risky it allows for 
much needed optimizations.  As a result of this choice, cumulus can be 
released without Nimbus, but Nimbus cannot be released without cumulus, 
and further, the only version of cumulus that can be allowed to operate 
with a given nimbus installation is the version of cumulus with which 
Nimbus was packages.

Example event sequence
----------------------

In the initial implementation the following sequence of events occurs. 
The user uploads the VM image 'vmimage' to 
cumulus://hostname.com/Repo/vmimage, and they request that the service 
run it.  The service then *directly* examines the cumulus database to 
see of the user has rights to that image.  If they do not an error is 
thrown.  However, if they do have rights the actual physical location of 
the file is looked up in the database and converted to an internal 
namespace suitable for propagation.  This internal name is sent to the 
workspace-control program.  An example internal name is 
scp://<repository host>/<file location>

To handle the namespace translation and various other tasks needed to 
deal with the cumulus integration the RepoFileSystemAdaptor interface 
was created.


Installation/Deployment
=======================

Cumulus is installed in via the ./bin/install script.  It is installed 
prior to the nimbus service.  There are a few crucial variables that are
set in the "./services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/cumulus.conf" file.
They are normally written automatically by the nimbus-configure program.

The variables are:

- cumulus.home.dir
    The cumulus install directory.  Typically $NIMBUS_HOME/cumulus

- cumulus.authz.db
    The cumulus authz database.  By default it is an sqlite database and 
    is located at $NIMBUS_HOME/cumulus/etc/authz.db

- cumulus.repo.dir
    The location of the cumulus posix backend file repository.  By default
    this is $NIMBUS_HOME/cumulus/posixdata.  Quite often users will want
    to change this to a more favorable location.  Likely one with more
    disk space or faster disks.

NOTE: If you move $NIMBUS_HOME, you need to call nimbus-configure again. 

If Nimbus is installed via ./scripts/all-build-and-install.sh these 
variables will have to be manually set.
