<h2>Nimbus is part of dev.globus</h2>

    To gain committer status and rights to the CVS repository, you need to

<p>
    Nimbus used to be known as "Virtual Workspaces" or the "Workspace Service"
    (which is just one Nimbus component).
    This is why the dev.globus <a href="http://dev.globus.org/wiki/Incubator/Virtual_Workspaces">Virtual
    Workspaces</a> page is named like that.
</p>

<h2>Incubator Status</h2>

<p>
    "Virtual Workspaces is an effort undergoing
    incubation at Globus. Incubation is required of all newly accepted
    projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure,
    communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner
    consistent with other successful Globus projects. While incubation status
    is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
    code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by
    Globus."
