<p>
    Need to edit the docs?
</p>
<p>
    <b>WARNING</b>: docs are in flux at the moment, this information is likely
    out of date.
</p>
<p>
    The first thing you should do is check the documentation tree out from CVS.
    Because each past Nimbus version gets its own tree, the entire checkout
    is rather large.  But you'll only need to do it once. 
</p>

<br />
<a name="checkout"> </a>
<h4>Checkout _NAMELINK(checkout)</h4>

<p>
    To check the docs out from CVS anonymously, run these commands:
</p>
_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/globdev/CVS/globus-packages
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END
_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
cvs co -P -d nimbus-docs workspace/docs
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<p>
    To check the docs out from CVS with your own account (intending on
    committing changes directly and not via patch), run these commands
    with "USERNAME" replaced by your username:
</p>
_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
export CVSROOT=:ext:USERNAME@cvs.globus.org:/home/globdev/CVS/globus-packages
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END
_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
cvs co -P -d nimbus-docs workspace/docs
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<br />
<a name="local-build"> </a>
<h4>Local build _NAMELINK(local-build)</h4>

<p>
    After you have a copy of the documentation tree, building and serving it
    locally takes one command:
</p>
_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
sh nimbus-docs/scripts/build-and-serve-locally.sh
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<p>
    This will print the URL to navigate to in your browser (something like
    "http://localhost:9999")

<h4>Understanding macros _NAMELINK(understanding-macros)</h4>
<!-- note, you must use the bold tags or some similar convention when talking
     about a macro on this page... since otherwise the macro processor will
     dereference it.  -->
<p>
    The docs make heavy use of m4 which is a macro processor.  The html page
    in the source tree will have something like <b>_</b>NIMBUS_HEADER in it
    which gets turned into the actual header HTML when the documentation is
    built.
</p>
<p>
    The best bet is to start out by copying already created macros.  If you want
    to create a new page, copy and paste the source contents (with the macros)
    of a page that will be next to it.  Change the page title by altering the
    argument to the <b>_</b>NIMBUS_HEADER macro.
</p>

<p>
    You will see something like "n,n,y,n,n,n,n" as an argument to some of the
    macros.  This controls which option in a list is shaded/selected (like the
    main navigation bar or a subsection sidebar).  To see which one to use,
    you may need to dip into the macro definitions in the "m4/worksp.lib.m4"
    file.
</p>

<h4>Popular macros _NAMELINK(popular-macros)</h4>
<!-- note, you must use the bold tags or some similar convention when talking
     about a macro on this page... since otherwise the macro processor will
     dereference it.  -->
<p>
    To make a command appear like so:
</p>
    
_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
sample command
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<p>
    ... look for examples of the <b>_</b>EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN macro which
    must be closed off with the <b>_</b>EXAMPLE_CMD_END macro.
</p>

<p>
    The <b>_</b>NAMELINK macro is useful for long pages, especially technical
    documentation.  Whenever you make an anchor like so:
    &lt;a name="some-section"&gt;
</p>
<p>
    ... put a <b>_</b>NAMELINK macro with an argument "some-section" like so:
    <b>_</b>NAMELINK(some-section)
</p>
<p>
    See an example next to the subsections on this page, it produces a hidden
    link that will show up when you hover next to where the anchor takes you.
    This lets users and developers quickly find anchors so that specific
    sections of the documentation can be referred to over email etc.
</p>

<a name="after-changes"> </a>
<h4>Rebuilding after changes _NAMELINK(after-changes)</h4>
<p>
    After you edit or add pages, preview the change by re-running the
    "build-and-serve-locally.sh" script.  If it was already running, simply
    press CTRL-C and launch it again.
</p>
<p>
    Once satisfied with the changes:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Commit changes to CVS: _EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
cvs commit
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END</li>
    <li>Log in to the computer where the live website lives: _EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
ssh <b>USERNAME@cvs.globus.org</b>
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END</li>
    <li>Make a scratch directory: _EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
mkdir /sandbox/USERNAME/somedir && cd /sandbox/USERNAME/somedir
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END</li>
    <li>Get the documentation scripts from CVS: _EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/globdev/CVS/globus-packages
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END</li>
    <li>_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
cvs co -d docscripts workspace/docs/scripts
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END</li>
    <li>Check out and build the documentation: _EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
bash docscripts/push_to_mcs_web.sh
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The "push_to_mcs_web.sh" will push any changes from the scratch directory
    to the live directory which lives @ "/www/workspace.globus.org/"
</p>
<p>
    After running that all once, you can return anytime to that node/directory
    and run the following command to push any updates:
</p>
_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
bash docscripts/push_to_mcs_web.sh update
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<br />
<a name="new-releases"> </a>
<h4>Docs for new releases _NAMELINK(new-releases)</h4>
<p>
    Making documentation for a new release consists of two different activities:
    1) creating and customizing a new "vm/$VERSION" subtree for the new version
    and 2) updating everything else (like the changelog, download page, news,
    etc.).
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Copy the last release tree to the new release tree: _EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
cp -a vm/TP2.2 vm/TP2.3
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove any CVS directories: _EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
find vm/TP2.3 -name CVS -type d -print -exec rm -rf {} \;
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Find/replace any occurence of "2.3" in the tree with "2.4".  Some
        of the occurences may be along the lines of "this feature is as of
        TP2.2" and it is not correct to change these.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Make any inserts or changes that are necessary because of changes in
        the software from the previous version.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Find/replace any occurrence of  <b>_</b>NIMBUS_TP2_2_DEPRECATED in
        the TP2.3 tree with a new macro we will make called
        <b>_</b>NIMBUS_TP2_3_DEPRECATED
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Open the "m4/worksp.lib.m4" file and make <b>_</b>NIMBUS_TP2_2_DEPRECATED
        macro look like a previous one.  And create a new
        <b>_</b>NIMBUS_TP2_3_DEPRECATED macro that has a comment only.  This
        will make any page on the TP2.2 pages flash a big deprecated warning
        and provide a link to the most recent version.  This is useful
        because people/search engines will often link to a page directly in a
        version's documentation: arriving here via such a link could mean the
        person will be unaware there is an update.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Update the <b>_</b>WORKSP_PREVIOUS_VM_VERSION and
        <b>_</b>WORKSP_CURRENT_VM_VERSION macros in the same file.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Update the "vm/changelog.html" page with all the new changes for the
        new release, give it a new section in the changelog that looks like
        the others.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Update the "vm/faq.html" and "vm/features.html" pages with any relevant
        changes.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Update the news with a release announcement (see a
        <a href="#news-items">following section</a> for information about
        how to do that).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Once all of the tarballs are in place (see the
        <a href="releases.html">release documentation)</a>, update
        "downloads/index.html" and "downloads/archive.html".  Move the current
        links for the old release to the archive page and update all of the
        text and links on the "downloads/index.html" to reflect the new release.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Add new files/directories to CVS and commit all the changes.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Doublecheck what happened on the live site.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>News items _NAMELINK(news-items)</h4>
<p>
    Making a news item requires editing three different files.
</p>
<p>
    First, make a unique anchor &lt;a&gt; tag in "news.html" and create an
    entry that looks like the others.  Only use full links to refer to the
    workspace documentation, do not use relative links.  If you use full links
    then people can click on the links in their RSS readers and get to the
    site.
</p>
<p>
    RSS is currently done manually. Open "rss.xml" and make a new section for
    a new item. Copy the title in for the title.  Copy the anchor tag for the
    item into the fields to uniquely identify the item.  Change the build date
    to reflect the current day.  Now copy in the exact &lt;p&gt; tags and their
    contents into the RSS entry.
</p>
<p>
    Copy the title and anchor into the front page of the website, "index.html"
    where the latest news entries are also mentioned.  Delete the oldest item to
    make room. 
</p>
<p>
    Rebuild the documentation as discussed above.  Test the RSS feed in your
    RSS reader but also use the link at the bottom of the "news.html" page
    to automatically test the validity of the rss.xml file against the RSS spec.
