<h2>Layout of the source directories _NAMELINK(code-layout)</h2>

    <p>
        The code lives under _PATH(workspace/vm) in CVS (see
        <a href="sccs.html">here</a> for details), all directory names will be
        referenced with the assumption that this is being prepended.  So if
        _PATH(backend/workspace) is referenced, in CVS that will be 
        _PATH(workspace/vm/backend/workspace)
    </p>

    <p>
        The source code has been through many changes but in some cases the
        decision was made to preserve the CVS history rather than moving the
        directory to a more organized place.  This is not a set in stone
        decision... whatever works best.
    </p>

    <p>
        While reading the following notes, it will help to have
        <a href="../faq.html#nimbus-main-components">this picture</a>
        in mind.
    </p>

    _MINI_SEP

    <p>
        The core of Nimbus is the <a href="../faq.html#rm-api">RM API</a>
        which lives in the _PATH(service-api/java/source) directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you navigate there you will find many things that are common to
        Nimbus source directories.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a construct borrowed from other Globus services: the
        component's hierarchy is first split by the language it is implemented
        in.  So the first directory here is _PATH(java).  Then there is
        a directory for source code and a directory for tests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under _PATH(source) are the _PATH(build.xml) and
        _PATH(build.properties) files which are specific to the component.
        Running "ant dist" in any Nimbus directory
        with a _PATH(build.xml) file is usually all you need to do in order to
        build that component.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though a much better option is to use the _PATH(scripts) scripts for building.
        The build file that the _PATH(scripts) scripts call is:
        _PATH(scripts/lib/gt4.0/build/build.xml)
    </p>
    <p>
        That file will build components with the proper dependencies. On many
        projects, source trees have their build.xml files call on other things
        to compile, etc., but this source tree's build.xml files -- if used
        directly -- will only look for dependencies in other directories.  If
        those dependencies are not built, then the build fails.  This lets the
        developer do what he or she wants to do with maximum control when
        mucking with build files directly.  The scripts in the "bin" directory
        are what both users and developers will use on a regular basis.
    </p>
    <p> 
        The RM API has no dependencies outside of this tree.  It contains its
        own "dummy" implementations of the APIs which do nothing.  If you
        instantiate the API (it bootstraps a
        <a href="http://www.springframework.net/doc-latest/reference/html/objects.html">Spring
        inversion of control</a> container), it will use the embedded
        configuration as its default.  This does nothing, it will just print
        things to the logger (which can be useful in some situations, for
        example when developing a new protocol implementation).
    </p>

    _MINI_SEP
    
    <p>
        Moving along, _PATH(service/service/java/source) contains the
        <a href="../faq.html#workspace-service">Workspace Service</a>
        site manager implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
        That implements the RM API.  Together, these two trees could be used
        in any number of Java containers.  There is no other dependency.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the _PATH(service/service/java/source/etc/workspace-service/other/main.xml)
        file you will find the Spring configurations that are used to instantiate
        the workspace service.  There are a number of internal plug points etc.,
        this is how that is all arranged.  The _PATH(.conf) files are never examined
        directly by the service, they are sucked into the Spring configuration
        using the magic of PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.  Open the
        _PATH(main.conflocator.xml) file next to _PATH(main.xml) to see how that works. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The service may call on some components that are not contained in the
        same tree but instead live in their own top level directories:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                _PATH(control) contains the standalone
                <a href="../faq.html#wcontrol">workspace control</a> program
                that is installed to the VMM nodes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                _PATH(pilot) contains the standalone
                <a href="../faq.html#wpilot">workspace pilot</a> which is
                submitted to a local batch scheduler (in some deployments) in
                order to reserve resources (VMMs).  <i><b>(advanced)</b></i>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                _PATH(plugins) contains plugin implementations for the workspace
                service.  These are broken out from the service tree mainly
                because they require dependencies (such as Jython) that are
                bulky and/or licensed in ways that may not be acceptable to
                people that need pure BSD/Apache style licensings.

    </ol>

    _MINI_SEP
    
    <p>
        Next thing to understand is the _PATH(messaging) directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        While not necessary, the RM API (and the main workspace service
        implementation of it) are intended to be used with a remote messaging
        implementation.  Some kind of protocol which is implemented by some kind
        of WS/REST/binary conventions and hosted by some kind of container
        technology (in all likelihood).
    </p>
    <p>
        The _PATH(messaging) directory contains two protocol implementations, each
        of them run in the Axis based Globus 4.0.x Java container.  As you can
        see from the subdirectories, the container glue and protocol implementations
        are intertwined.  When making a new permutation of protocol and
        container, you typically need to worry about both at the same time to
        make it work.
    </p>
    <p>
        The _PATH(messaging/gt4.0/java/stubs) directory contains the auto-generated
        Axis stub classes that are used to marshall/demarshall the WSRF protocol
        based Nimbus messages.
    </p>
    <p>
        The _PATH(messaging/gt4.0/java/msgbridge) directory contains everything
        necessary to actually take messages off the wire, initially consume
        them, and translate them into RM API calls.
    </p>
    <p>
        The _PATH(messaging/gt4.0-elastic) directory contains similar things for the
        EC2 WS protocol hosted in the Globus 4.0.x Java container.
    </p>
    <p>
        The _PATH(messaging/gt4.0/java/gar-builder) directory contains the
        scripts that produce the "final
        packaging."  That is, this is the master directory for building a
        "GAR" file which is what is actually deployed into the Globus 4.0.x Java
        container.  Both the WSRF and "elastic" interfaces are stuffed into
        this GAR creation process, as well as any dependency (i.e., the RM API
        and any of its dependencies ... and the workspace service and any of
        its dependencies).
    </p>
    <p>
        So the final product for the service (the GAR files) that is deployed
        is something of an onion.  The layers around the outside are very
        specific to the deployment and wire technology but as you peel things
        away you become more and more generic.
    </p>

    <p>
        A related thing to understand is that the initialization sequence works
        in the same way.  The container boots, the Axis service is initialized
        (because the "loadOnStartup" configuration is true), the service is tied
        in with the container's JNDI system, a JNDI configuration points to the
        Spring configuration, and then the Spring configuration takes over.  99%
        of the configuration is done via Spring, but something needs to kick
        everything off and via Container->JNDI is how it works.
    </p>

    _MINI_SEP

    <p>
        Next up, something needs to call the service.  The
        _PATH(service/client/java/source) directory is where all of the client code
        lives (EC2 clients work too).
    </p>
    <p>
        Navigate to _PATH(service/client/java/source/src/org/globus/workspace).
        There are several different layers here.  _PATH(client_core) is where all of
        the code is to make actual calls to the service, it is a collection of
        convenience wrappers around the web services stubs and the returned
        data structures (and notifications/polling helpers).  These wrappers
        make it easier to use the different operations as "building blocks" for
        higher level actions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The _PATH(client) package (sibling of _PATH(client_core)) is where the "reference
        client" is implemented.  This is a commandline wrapper around the
        _PATH(client_core) basic actions.  It has several "modes" which are each an
        "orchestration" of various actions.  This client can handle any operation
        the service supports and provides many useful utilities for getting
        things done in the expected order ("create, then monitor", etc.).
    </p>

    <p>
        Both the _PATH(client) and the _PATH(client_core) classes are ripe for
        inserting into portals and other new types of clients.
    </p>

    <p>
        The _PATH(cloud) package, however, is not geared towards programmatic
        re-use (parts of it could be, but they were not intentionally written
        for this).  This is another commandline program but
        it is fully geared towards human use.  There are many default parameters
        and behaviors that are
        simplifications of what is possible with the Nimbus API, but definitely
        right for users that are getting started or only have the typical needs.
    </p>

    <p>
        The cloud client is packaged separately, and this Java code is in it,
        it gets installed (via "ant deploy" in the _PATH(service/client/java/source)
        directory) into the embedded GLOBUS_LOCATION in the cloud client
        (_PATH(lib/globus)).
    </p>

    _MINI_SEP

    <p>
        The _PATH(autoconfiguaration) directory contains programs and scripts that
        run the configuration wizard for installing <i>and maintaining</i> the
        server side, the "administrator wizard".
    </p>
    <p>
        This is
        contained in the GAR files when Nimbus is installed to a container, it
        is installed into the _PATH($GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/nimbus-autoconfig)
        directory and is a standalone thing.  It asks questions and can alter
        some of the configuration files, its sole purpose is to make it so the
        user has to understand less to get things up and running initially.
    </p>

    <p>
        The _PATH(autocontainer) directory contains
        a standalone system for making the, you guessed it,
        <a href="../faq.html#autocontainer">AutoContainer</a>.  To make a new
        release, run the
        _PATH(autocontainer/lib/prepare-for-auto-container-release.sh) script.
    </p>

    <p>
        That script will download a new Globus container (if the tarball is not
        already present) and adjust some of the config files to make them ready
        to be autoconfigured when the user downloads and runs the AutoContainer.
        This ensures we're never storing the ~20MB Globus container itself in
        source control.
    </p>

    <p>
        The _PATH(autocommon) directory contains libraries and code that are
        used by both the AutoContainer and the administrator wizard.
    </p>

    _MINI_SEP

    <p>
        That's the bird's eye view.  Ask questions about any of this on the
        <a href="_NIMBUS_WEBSITE/contact/#dev">developer's list</a>.

<a name="change-wsdl"> </a>
<h2>Changing the WSDL _NAMELINK(change-wsdl)</h2>

<p>
    This section discusses making changes to WSDL and generating new stub
    classes, etc.  It assumes you have some understanding of the layers and
    source code directions discussed in the <a href="#code-layout">code layout
    section</a>.
</p>

<p>
    First run _PATH(bin/all-clean.sh).
</p>
<p>
    Then edit the "compact" WSDL in the
    _PATH(messaging/gt4.0/schema/compact/workspace/) directory.  Note that the
    EC2 WSDL works the same way but we are using the WSRF ones as an example.
</p>
<p>
    Compact WSDL
    is a Globus convention, it facilitates an inheritance mechanism that allows
    the final WSDL to contain common WSRF/WSN related operations.  You edit the
    compact WSDL only and then a program will "compile" that into the real
    WSDL/schemas.
</p>

<p>
    Once you have edited something, the changes will not be picked up by the
    build system until you have run "ant" in the
    _PATH(messaging/gt4.0/schema/compact/) directory.  This triggers the default
    ant target of "copyToDeployableComponent" which will take the "compact" files
    and put the (generated) real WSDL/schemas under the
    _PATH(messaging/gt4.0/schema/dist/) directory.
</p>

<p>
    That directory is what the build system uses to generate the stubs (the
    Axis classes that are actually referenced by the Nimbus code for
    un/marshalling of the web services).  So, because you ran
    _PATH(bin/all-clean.sh) already, running _PATH(bin/all-build.sh) now will
    generate stubs with the changes you have added.
</p>

<p>
	That creates the new wsdl.  Now you need to create the auto-generated "stub"
	code Java jars.  Do this by running "scripts/stubs-build.sh" 
</p>

<p>
    Unless you added something entirely new, the corresponding messaging layer
    (e.g., _PATH(messaging/gt4.0/java/msgbridge)) will probably not compile
    now.  So the next step is to move up the stack and make it work.
