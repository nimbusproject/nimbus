        <p>
            Problem: Trying to use EC2 client but getting an error like: _NAMELINK(elastic-no-operation-error)
        </p>
        <div class="screen"><pre>
SecurityException: [SEC]Operation name could not be determined</pre></div>
        <p>
            Solution: Either the elastic service is not installed at the target
            URL or you are using the wrong client tools.  Amazon EC2 upgrades
            happen without warning and so there is sometimes a sync error
            between their default tools and the tools needed to work with
            particular Nimbus elastic services.
        </p>

        <p>
            The current release is known to work with
            <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads/ec2-api-tools-1.3-42584.zip">this specific version</a>
            of the EC2 client tools (compatible with EC2 WSDL 2009-08-15).

            Problem: Trying to use EC2 client but getting an error like: _NAMELINK(elastic-pubkey-error)
        </p>
        <div class="screen"><pre>
CertificateParsingException: invalid DER-encoded certificate data</pre></div>
        <p>
            Solution: These clients typically only handle un-annotated public
            certificate text blobs.  Make a new file with just these lines from
            the bottom of the problem certificate pem file:
        </p>

        <div class="screen"><pre>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIICKjCCAZOgAwIBA [...]
-----END CERTIFICATE-----</pre></div>

        <p>
            And make sure to point the tools at the new file:
        </p>
_EXAMPLE_CMD_BEGIN
export EC2_CERT=/path/to/new/file/usercert-justcert.pem
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

            Problem: Trying to use EC2 client but getting an error like: _NAMELINK(elastic-privkey-error)
        </p>
        <div class="screen"><pre>
IOException: DER length more than 4 bytes</pre></div>
        <p>
            Solution: These clients typically only handle unencrypted private
            keys, you are perhaps using an encrypted private key.  Make an
            unencrypted version like so:
        </p>
_EXAMPLE_CMD_BEGIN
openssl rsa -in userkey.pem -out bare-userkey.pem
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END
_EXAMPLE_CMD_BEGIN
chmod 400 bare-userkey.pem
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END
_EXAMPLE_CMD_BEGIN
export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY=/path/to/new/file/bare-userkey.pem
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END
    </li>

        <p>
            Problem: Trying to use EC2 client but getting an error like:  _NAMELINK(elastic-ssl-error)
        </p>
        <div class="screen"><pre>
"unable to find valid certification path to requested target"</pre></div>

        <p>
            Solution: This means the EC2 client does not trust the https
            endpoint.  This is likely because the endpoint is not using an SSL
            certificate signed by the standard Java JRE's trusted CAs.
        </p>
        <p>
            An option here is to use
            <a href="_NIMBUS_WEBSITE/downloads/install-cert-1.tar.gz">this program</a> (source
            included) to add the certificate.  It will contact the endpoint,
            retrieve the advertised certificate, and then give you an option to
            create a new "keystore" with the old trusted certificates and the
            new one you just added.
        </p>
        <p>
            To enable the newly created keystore, you need to copy it to the JRE's
            security directory, for example:
        </p>

_EXAMPLE_ROOTCMD_BEGIN
mv /opt/sun-jdk-1.6.0.07/jre/lib/security/cacerts /opt/sun-jdk-1.6.0.07/jre/lib/security/cacerts.backup
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

_EXAMPLE_ROOTCMD_BEGIN
cp jssecacerts /opt/sun-jdk-1.6.0.07/jre/lib/security/cacerts
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

        <p>
            As noted <a href="reference.html#elastic">here</a>, using http
            and not https to host the service is not a good idea.

            Problem: Trying to use EC2 client <i>for the first time as the
            site administrator testing the installation</i> but getting an
            error like:  _NAMELINK(elastic-timestamp-error)

        <div class="screen"><pre>
General: An error was discovered processing the &lt;wsse:Security&gt; header.

        java.text.ParseException: Unparseable date: "2008-08-07T16:23:22.885Z"</pre></div>

        <p>
            Solution: Make sure you have altered the container configuration
            correctly to handle EC2 clients, as explained
            <a href="reference.html#elastic">here</a>.
            Container restart required after the configuration change.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a sample container <i>server-config.wsdd</i> configuration
            to compare against
            <a href="sample-server-config.wsdd-supporting-ec2.xml">here</a>.

            Solution: Make sure you have altered the container configuration

            Container restart required after the configuration change.
        </p>
        <p>
            In particular, this may be that you have "X509EncryptHandler"
            disabled instead of "X509SignHandler".

        <p>
            There is a sample container <i>server-config.wsdd</i> configuration

        <p>
            Problem: The VMs do not obtain addresses via DHCP. _NAMELINK(service-no-dhcp)
        </p>
        <p>
            Solution: Make sure dom0's interface name(s) configuration is valid,
            the "dhcpvif" part of the association configuration in the
            worksp.conf file. See the backend networking configuration section
            for more details and the right setting to use.

    <li>
        <a name="service-bad-mac-prefix"> </a>
        <p>
            Problem: Sometimes, from the start of the workspace's deployment,
            one of the VM's NICs is unreachable. (specifically, the ARP protocol
            does not resolve the IP address to a MAC address) _NAMELINK(service-bad-mac-prefix)
        </p>
        <p>
            Solution: Make sure the MAC address prefix is valid. See the backend
            networking configuration section for more details and the right
            setting to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            The service should be checking the validity of the MAC prefix
            now actually, you should never have this problem...
        </p>
    </li>

<br /><hr />
    
    <li>
        <a name="service-two-etc-dirs"> </a>
        <p>
            Problem: The container doesn't start anymore and you are getting a
            long JNDI related exception. You see "InvocationTargetException"
            and "NameAlreadyBoundException" and probably "Name home is already
            bound in this Context". > _NAMELINK(service-two-etc-dirs)
        </p>
        <p>
            Solution: This will happen if you make a backup of the
            "etc/nimbus" directory inside the etc directory. For example,
            you ran "cp -a nimbus nimbus_backups". The container thinks these
            are both directories for services and tries to consume both
            JNDI files. Hence, the configurations are consumed multiple
            times which is an error because only one of each can be
            "bound in this context" at a time.

        <a name="libvirt-debian"> </a>

            Problem: The workspace-control "sbin/test-dependencies.sh" fails
            to work on Debian.
            _NAMELINK(libvirt-debian)
        </p>
        <p>
            Debian has an old libvirt version so installing it is often a matter
            of running "configure --with-python; make; make install"
        </p>
        <p>
            But that still may make the "sbin/test-dependencies.sh" script fail
            because the "import libvirt" statement will not work at all.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Solution: Add the location of libvirt.so.0 to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
            environment variable.

        <p>
            This typically means you have gotten into a situation where the
