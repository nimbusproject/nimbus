<h2>Cloud configuration overview _NAMELINK(cloud-overview)</h2>

<p>
    The cloud configuration is a particular configuration of Nimbus that allows the cloud-client to
    operate out of the box.  It is what is set up when you are done with the
    <a href="z2c/index.html">Zero To Cloud Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>
    This overview section and subsequent reference sections give a more in-depth explanation of how
    it works in order to provide context for administrators running Nimbus in production that want to
    customize settings or understand things in a more "under the hood" way for security/networking reasons.
</p>

<p>
    <i>This is all information for <b>deployers</b> of the cloud configuration to learn about it and customize it.  This is
    <b>not necessary for cloud users</b> to read and understand.</i>  If you
    are a cloud user just looking to understand how to launch and manage VMs
    on an existing cloud, start with the <a href="../clouds/">clouds</a> pages.
</p>

<p>
    In the Nimbus 2.5 release the repository service (<a href="#cumulus">Cumulus</a>) and the IaaS services
    MUST be on the same node.  In future releases this restriction will
    be lifted.
</p>

<p>
    The server addresses must be directly reachable from the Internet
    or otherwise configured to deal with being NAT'd.  The IaaS services container can be setup for NAT or other port
    forwarding situations.  Cumulus should be NAT friendly so long as
    its listening port (default 8888) is forwarded through the NAT.
</p>

<p>
    <img src="../img/cloud-overview-rt.png" alt="workspace cloud configuration" />
</p>
<p>
    The diagram above depicts the basic setup.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A special workspace client called the "cloud-client" invokes operations
        on the Iaas services and Cumulus server.  A number of defaults are assumed which makes this work out of the box (these defaults will be discussed
        later).
    </li>
    <li>
        Files are transferred from the cloud-client to a client-specific
        storage system  on the repository node (manual or other types of
        S3 protocol
        based transfers are also possible for advanced users).
    </li>
    <li>
        The service invokes commands on the VMMs to trigger file transfers
        to/from the repository node, VM lifecycle events, and destruction/clean
        up.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the workspace state changes, the cloud-client will reflect this to
        the screen (and log files) and depending on the change might also take
        action in response.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Cloud configuration user experience _NAMELINK(cloud-userexp)</h2>

<p>
    Working backwards from the user's <tt class="literal">cloud-client</tt> experience is a
    good way to understand how the service needs to be setup.
</p>

<p>
    Here is an abbreviated depiction of a simple user interaction with a cloud,
    to give you an idea if you've never used it.  This does not depict an
    image transfer to the repository node but that is similarly brief.
</p>

        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            You can list what's in your repository directory:

<a name="cloud-assumptions"> </a>
<h2>Cloud configuration assumptions and defaults _NAMELINK(cloud-assumptions)</h2>

<p>
    A number of things go into making the cloud client work out of the box,
    but it is in large part accomplished by giving the user a downloadable
    package with a number of default configurations.
</p>

<p>
    These defaults limit functionality options in some cases, but that is the
    idea: eliminate decisions that need to be made and set working defaults.
    There are avenues left open for experienced users to do more
    (for example, by overriding the defaults or even switching over to the
    regular workspace client).
</p>

<p>
    In the previous section, the first thing that probably stands out is that
    there are no contact addresses being entered on the command line.
</p>

<p>
    The service and repository URLs are derived from a properties file
    that is included in the toplevel "conf" directory of the cloud-client
    package.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    <b>Note</b>: How properties files and commandline overrides work is covered
    in a <a href="#cloud-properties">later section</a> in detail, it is all designed to be
    flexible under the covers.  If you don't want to follow the conventions
    laid out in this current "assumptions" section, it will be important to
    understand the later section to know how to change things for a good
    client package or properties file(s) that your users can use.  Continue
    reading this section first, though, to get the basic ideas.
</p>

<p>
    There are three main groups of assumptions and defaults.  The first is the
    contact and identity information of the workspace service
    (see above for configuration sample where this are specified).
    The other two groups make up the rest of this "Assumptions" section:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#cloud-personaldir">Deriving per-user repository directories</a></li>
    <li><a href="#cloud-runtime">Runtime assumptions</a></li>
</ul>


<a name="cloud-personaldir"> </a>
<h3>Deriving per-user repository directories _NAMELINK(cloud-personaldir)</h3>

<p>
    For Cumulus S3 based commands (like <i>--list</i>, <i>--delete</i>, and
    <i>--transfer</i>) the server to contact is based on the contact in
    the cloud properties file.  The s3id and s3 secret to authenticate with
    the Cumulus server is stored in the
    cloud properties file.
</p>

<p>
    When you transfer a local file, the target of the transfer is the same
    filename in your personal repository directory. When you refer to the name
    of a workspace to run, this name must correspond to a filename in your
    personal repository directory.
</p>

<p>
    We know where the repository comes from but how is that directory derived?
</p>

<p>
    There are two other components to derive the directory used: the configured
    <i>base bucket property</i> and the <i>user S3 ID</i>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The configured <i>base directory property</i>.  The default
        configuration for the base bucket on the repository node is
        "<b>Repo</b>".  This value can be changed in the cloud.properties
        file so long as it matches the particular clouds setup.  It is
        best to not alter this value.
    </li>
</ul>


<p class="indent">
    <i>
        There is a cloud-client option to input any name or local
        file path and see what the derived URL is.  See the --extrahelp
        description of the --print-file-URL option.
    </i>
</p>

<a name="cloud-runtime"> </a>
<h3>Runtime assumptions _NAMELINK(cloud-runtime)</h3>

<p>
    The second set of assumptions to cover is how a given image file is going
    to actually work.  There are many options that you can specify in regular
    workspace requests.  For example, the memory size, the number of network
    interfaces to construct, the pool name(s) to lease network addresses from,
    and the partition name the VM is expecting for the base partition.
</p>

<p>
    Some fixed assumptions are made:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>There can be only <b>one network interface</b></li>
    <li>The network interface <b>is expecting its address via DHCP</b></li>
    <li>
        There can be only <i>one partition file</i>, for the root partition,
        configured with an ext2/ext3 filesystem.  Other filesystems may not
        work correctly (this has to do with the cloud's default kernel as well
        as its ability to edit the image's files before boot).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The rest of the launch request is filled by default configurations,
    here they are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Request <b>3584</b> MB of memory (this is usually overriden)</li>
    <li>Request networking address from a pool named <b>public</b></li>
    <li>Mount the partition to <b>sda1</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Cloud configuration, necessary configurations _NAMELINK(cloud-necessary)</h2>

<p>
    The previous section summed up the defaults and main assumptions.  Opting
    to follow these conventions in your cloud leads to these configuration
    conclusions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Install the workspace service in
            <a href="../admin/reference.html#resource-pool-and-pilot">resource
            pool mode</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Configure an
            <a href="../admin/quickstart.html#networks">network</a>
            for addresses to lease from and call it "<b>public</b>".
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Create a <i>cloud.properties</i> file for your cloud with
            the values in this <a href="../examples/cloud.properties">example
            file</a> changed to reflect the correct URLs and identities.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is best to distribute a unique cloud.properties for each user with the Cumulus credentials in the file already, this is easily set up when using the nimbus-new-user program and the Nimbus web application.  See the <a href="#user-management">user management</a> section for details.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If you need to adjust the default memory request, add a line of
            text like so to the <i>cloud.properties</i> file you will
            distribute:  <b>vws.memory.request=256</b>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Create a <i>Repo</i> base bucket on the repository node.
            This should be done by the Nimbus installer.
        </p>
    </li>

</ul>

<a name="cloud-properties"> </a>
<h2>Cloud configuration property reference _NAMELINK(cloud-properties)</h2>

<p>
    This section goes into more detail about the property file and commandline
    configurations.  This is especially important to understand if you want
    to diverge from the defaults above.
</p>

<div>

    <img src="../img/cloud-client-layout.png"
         alt="workspace cloud client layout"
         class="floatright" />

    <p>
        All commands go through <i>cloud-client.sh</i> which in turn
        invokes the actual cloud client program.  The cloud client is written
        in Java and installed at <i>lib/globus/lib/workspace_client.jar</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before calling this program, the script sets up some things:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <i>../conf/cloud.properties</i> is set as the user properties file
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>../lib/globus</i> becomes the new GLOBUS_LOCATION (overriding
            anything previously set)
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>../lib/certs</i> is set as a directory to add to the trusted
            X509 certificate directories for identity validations (the client
            verifies it is talking to the right servers).  Adding the CA cert(s)
            of the workspace service certificates to this
            directory ensures that the user will not run into CA (trusted
            certificates) problems.
        </li>
    </ul>
<p>
    The cloud client program respects settings from <b>three</b> different
    places, listed here in the <b>order of precedence</b>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Commandline arguments</b> - If the client uses one of the
            optional flags listed in <i>./bin/cloud-client.sh --extrahelp</i>,
            these values are used.  Many things can be overriden this way,
            including the service contacts.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>User properties file</b> - An example of this is distributed with the cloud client.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that you can include different properties files and have your
            users switch between clouds using
            <i>./bin/cloud-client.sh --conf ./conf/some-file</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If no <i>--conf</i> argument is supplied, the default file
            <i>cloud.properties</i> needs to exist.  If you need to change
            this in your client distribution for cosmetic reasons, you can
            do so by editing the one relevant line at the top of
            <i>./bin/cloud-client.sh</i>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>

<h2>User management _NAMELINK(user-management)</h2>


<p>
    In order to manage Nimbus user more easily a set of command line tools
    have been created.
</p>

<UL>
    <LI>nimbus-new-user</LI>
    <LI>nimbus-list-users</LI>
    <LI>nimbus-edit-user</LI>
    <LI>nimbus-remove-user</LI>
</UL>

<p>
All of the tools take as a single mandatory argument an email address, with
the slight exception of <i>nimbus-list-users</i>.  nimbus-list-users allows
an administrator to query for users on their systems therefore it takes
as an argument a query pattern.  For example, if you wanted to look up
all the users with email addresses at gmail.com you would run:
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ nimbus-list-users %@gmail.com
</pre>

<p>
All of the command line tools take the argument --help and further information
can be found there.  For didactic purposes an example of a common session in which a
new user is created, changes, listed and removed follows:

<a name="elastic"> </a>
<h2>Enabling the EC2 SOAP frontend _NAMELINK(elastic)</h2>
<p>
    After installing, the EC2 query frontend should be immediately
    operational. However if you wish you use the SOAP frontend as well,
    you must make a few configuration changes. To begin, see the
    <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/elastic</tt>
    directory.  The <tt class="literal">elastic.conf</tt> file here specifies
    what the EC2 "instance type"
    allocations should translate to and what networks should be requested
    from the underlying workspace service when VM create requests are sent.
</p>

<p>
    By default, a Nimbus installation will enable this service:
</p>

<div class="screen"><pre>
https://10.20.0.1:8443/wsrf/services/ElasticNimbusService
</pre></div>

<p>
    But before the service will work, you must adjust a container configuration.
    This will account for some security related customs for EC2:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Secure message is used, but only on the request.  No secure message
            envelope is sent around EC2 responses, therefore EC2 clients do not
            expect such a response.  It relies on the fact that <b>https</b>
            is being used to protect responses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both integrity and encryption problems are relevant, be wary of any
            http endpoint being used with this protocol.  For example, you
            probably want to make sure that add-keypair private key
            responses are encrypted (!).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Also, adjusting the container configuration gets around a timestamp
            format incompatibility we discovered (the timestamp is normalized
            <i>after</i> the message envelope signature/integrity is confirmed).
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    There is a sample container <i>server-config.wsdd</i> configuration
    to compare against
    <a href="sample-server-config.wsdd-supporting-ec2.xml">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Edit the container deployment configuration:
</p>
_EXAMPLE_CMD_BEGIN
nano -w etc/globus_wsrf_core/server-config.wsdd
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<p>
    Find the <b>&lt;requestFlow&gt;</b> section and comment out the existing
    <i>WSSecurityHandler</i> and add this new one:

<a name="query"> </a>
<h2>Configuring the EC2 Query frontend _NAMELINK(query)</h2>

<p>
The EC2 Query frontend supports the same operations as the SOAP frontend.
However, it does not run in the same container. It listens on HTTPS using Jetty.
Starting with Nimbus 2.4, the query frontend is enabled and listens on port 8444.
For instructions on changing this port, see the
<a href="#service-ports">service ports</a> section.
</p>

<p>
Configuration for the query frontend lives in the
    <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/query/query.conf</tt>
    file.
</p>

<p>
The Query interface does not rely on X509 certificates for security. Instead,
it uses a symmetric signature-based approach. Each user is assigned an access
identifier and secret key. These credentials are also maintained by the service.
Each request is "signed" by the client by generating a hash of parts of the
request and attaching them. The service performs this same signature process
and compares its result with the one included in the request.
</p>

<!-- mention any safeguards against replay attacks? -->

<p>
    There is support for creating query credentials in the nimbus-new-user program, for more information see the <a href="#user-management">user management</a> section.
</p>

<p>
    There is support for distributing query tokens
    via the <a href="../faq.html#nimbusweb">Nimbus Web</a> application.

    The assorted Nimbus and Cumulus services use several network ports. Each is configured with sensible
    defaults, but you may change them if needed. Below are instructions for changing the port of each service.
</p>

<h3>Nimbus core services (default 8443)</h3>
<p>
    Edit <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/libexec/run-services.sh</tt> and change the
    <tt class="literal">PORT</tt> line to your desired port number. You must restart the service

<h3>Nimbus EC2 query frontend (default 8444)</h3>
<p>
    Edit <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/query/query.conf</tt> and
    adjust the <tt class="literal">https.port</tt> line. You must restart the service
    for changes to take effect.
</p>

<h3>Cumulus (default 8888)</h3>
<p>
    The configuration options for Cumulus can be found in
    <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/cumulus/etc/cumulus.ini</tt>.
    Under the heading <tt class="literal">[cb]</tt> there is a <tt class="literal">port</tt>

    program.
</p>
<pre class="panel">

port = 8888
hostname = &lt;hostname&gt;
</pre>

<p>
    <i>note:</i>
    If this change is made after you have distributed a cloud.properties
    file to users then you will need to instruct your cloud-client users
    to change the value <tt class="literal">vws.repository=&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</tt>
    in their local cloud.properties file.

</p>

<h3>Nimbus Web application (default 1443)</h3>
<p>
    When enabled, the web application listens by default on port 1443. This and other configuration
    options are location in the <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/web/nimbusweb.conf</tt>

<a name="nimbusweb-usage"> </a>
<h2>Using the Nimbus Web interface <span class="namelink"><a href="#nimbusweb-usage">(#)</a></span>
</h2>

<p>
    The Nimbus web application provides basic facilities for distributing new X509 credentials, EC2 query tokens, and cloud.properties files to users.
    
</p>
<p>
    Previously this was a tedious process that was difficult to do in a secure way that was also user friendly. Nimbus Web allows an admin to upload credentials for a user and then send them a custom URL which invites them to create an account.
</p>
<p>
    Once the web application has been configured, you can start to use it with the nimbus-new-user program (see the help output, -W flag), which allows you to very quickly add a user to the system and get the URL to distribute in your welcome email.  The <a href="#user-management">user management</a> tools provide machine parsable output options that make it easy to incorporate into scripts as well (perhaps you would like to go further and create those emails entirely programmatically).
</p>
<p>
    To get started, log into the web interface as a superuser and go to the
    <i>Administrative Panel</i>. This page has a section for creating users
    as well as viewing pending and existing users.  The best way to do this is by using the nimbus-new-user tool, but this option is available for you to create accounts manually.
</p>

<p>
    If you go the manual route: fill in the appropriate fields and upload an X509 certificate and (passwordless) key for the user. Note that the application expects plain text files, so depending on your browser you may need to rename files to have a .txt extension before you can upload them. Once the new account is created, you will be provided with a custom URL. You must paste this URL into an email to the user along with usage instructions.
</p>

<p>
    When the user accesses the custom URL, they will be asked to create a password
    and login. Inside their account, they can download the certificate and key which
    were provided for them by the admin. Note that the design of the application attempts
    to maximize the security of the process, with several important features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>The URL token can only be successfully used once</b>. After a
        user creates a password and logs in, future attempts to access that URL will
        fail. This is to prevent someone from intercepting the URL and using it to
        access the user's credentials. If this happens, the real user will be unable
        to login and will (hopefully) contact the administrator immediately (there is a message urging them to do so).
    </li>
    <li>
        In the same spirit, <b>the URL token will expire</b> after a configurable number of
        hours (default: 12).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>The user's X509 private key can be downloaded once and only once</b>.
        After this download occurs,
        the key will be deleted from the server altogether. In an ideal security system,
        no person or system will ever be in possession of a private key, except for the
        user/owner of the key itself. Because we don't follow this for the sake of usability,
        we attempt to minimize the time that the private key is in the web app database.
    </li>
    <li>
        When a URL token is accessed or a private key is downloaded, the time and IP address of
        this access is logged and displayed in the administrative panel. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The nimbus-new-user tool can create a custom cloud.properties file to use with your cloud.  This will have all the right configurations as well as the user's query credentials in the "vws.repository.s3id" and "vws.repository.s3key" fields for using Cumulus.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuring a different host certificate _NAMELINK(cert-pointing)</h2>

<p>
    The Nimbus installer creates a Certificate Authority which is used for
    (among other things) generating a host certificate for the various services.
    There are three files involved in your host certificate and they
    are all generated during the install by the <em>nimbus-configure</em> program.
    By default, these files are placed in "$NIMBUS_HOME/var/" but you can control
    their placement with properties in the "$NIMBUS_HOME/nimbus-setup.conf" file.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>hostcert.pem</b> - The host certificate.
        The certificate for the issuing CA must be in the Nimbus trusted-certs
        directory, in hashed format.
    </li>
    <li><b>hostkey.pem</b> - The private key. Must be unencrypted and readable
    by the Nimbus user.</li>
    <li><b>keystore.jks</b> - Some Nimbus services require this special Java
    Key Store format. The <em>nimbus-configure</em> program generates this
    file from the host cert and key. If you delete the file, it can
    be regenerated by running <em>nimbus-configure</em> again.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    To use a custom host certificate, you can delete (or relocate)
    these three files, copy in your own hostcert.pem and hostkey.pem, and run
    <em>nimbus-configure</em>, which will generate the keystore.
</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title">CA Certs</p>
    It is important that the issuing CA cert is trusted by Nimbus (and any
    clients used to access the Nimbus services). This is done by placing the
    hashed form of the CA files in the trusted-certs directory, by default
    "$NIMBUS_HOME/var/ca/trusted-certs/". For example, these three files:
</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title">Cumulus https</p>
    <b>NOTE:</b>
    If you are using Cumulus with https you will need to point it at the
    correct certificates as well.  This is further explained 
    <a href="#cumulus-https">here.</a>
</p>
</div>

<div class="screen"><pre>
3fc18087.0
3fc18087.r0
3fc18087.signing_policy
</pre></div>
<p>
    If you simply want to generate new host certificates using the Nimbus
    internal CA (perhaps using a different hostname), you can follow a
    similar procedure. Delete or relocate the hostcert.pem, hostkey.pem,
    and keystore.jks files and then run <em>nimbus-configure</em>. New
    files will be generated.
</p>

<p>
    You can also keep these files outside of the Nimbus install (for example if
    you use the same host certificate for multiple services on the same machine.
    Just edit the $NIMBUS_HOME/nimbus-setup.conf file and adjust the hostcert,
    hostkey, and keystore properties. Then run <em>nimbus-configure</em>. If these files
    do not exist, they will be created.

    provide "public" and "private" but these can be anything.  If you do change
    this, the cloud client configuration for what network(s) to request will
    need to be overriden in the cloud.properties file that you distribute to
    users.
</p>

<p>
    The <i>public</i> file has some comments in it.  Edit this file to have
    the one DNS line at the top and one network address to give out.  The
    subnet and network you choose should be something the VMM node can bridge
    to (there are some advanced configs to be able to do DHCP and bridge
    addresses for addresses that are foreign to the VMM, but this is not
    something addressed in this guide).

<p>
    It is possible to force specific MAC addresses for each IP address, see the file for syntax details.  Usually the service will pick these for you from a pool of MAC addresses starting with a prefix that is configured in the "$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/network.conf" file.

<h2>Resource pool and pilot configurations _NAMELINK(resource-pool-and-pilot)</h2>
<p>
    There are modules for two resource management strategies currently
    distributed with Nimbus: the default "resource pool" mode and the "pilot"
    mode.
</p>
<p>
    The "resource pool" mode is where the service has direct control of a pool
    of VMM nodes.  The service assumes it can start VMs 
</p>
<p>
    The "pilot" mode is where the service makes a request to a cluster's
    Local Resource Management System (LRMS) such as PBS.  The VMMs are equipped
    to run regular jobs in domain 0.  But if pilot jobs are submitted, the nodes
    are secured for VM management for a certain time period by the workspace
    service.  If the LRM or
    administrator preempts/kills the pilot job earlier than expected, the VMM
    is no longer available to the workspace service. 
</p>
<p>
    The "services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/other/<b>resource-locator-ACTIVE.xml</b>"
    file dictates what mode is in use (container restart required if this
    changes).  See the available
    "services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/other/<b>resource-locator-*</b>" files.
</p>

<a name="resource-pool"> </a>
<h3>Resource pool _NAMELINK(resource-pool)</h3>
<p>
    This is the default, see the <a href="#resource-pool-and-pilot">overview</a>.
</p>

<p>
    A directory of files is located at
    "services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/<b>vmm-pools</b>/"
</p>
<p>
   The pool file format is currently simple: for each node in the pool,
   list the hostname and the amount of RAM it can spare for running guest VMs.
</p>
<p>
   Optionally, you can also specify that certain hosts can only
   support a subset of the available networks (see the
   file comments for syntax).
</p>
<p>
   If you change these configuration files after starting the
   container, only a fresh container reboot will actually incur the
   changes.
</p>

<ul>

    <li>
        If you <b>add</b> a node, this will be available
        immediately after the container reboot.
    </li>

    <li>
        If you <b>remove</b> a node that is currently
        in use, no new deployments will be mapped to this VMM.
        However, this will not destroy (or migrate) any current VMs
        running there.  If that is necessary it currently needs to be
        accomplished explicitly.
    </li>

    <li>
        If you <b>change</b> a node that is currently
        in use, the change will take effect for the next lease.

        <p>
        If you've removed support for an association on a VMM that
        the current VM(s) is using, this change will not destroy (or
        migrate) the VM(s) to adjust to this restriction.
        If that is necessary it currently needs to be accomplished
        explicitly.
        </p>


        <p>
        If you've reduced the memory allocation below what the
        current VM(s) on the node is/are currently using, this will
        not destroy (or migrate) the current VM(s) to adjust to this
        restriction.
        If that is necessary it currently needs to be accomplished
        explicitly.  Once the VM(s) are gone, the maximum memory
        available on that VMM will be the new, lower maximum.
        </p>
    </li>

</ul>


<a name="pilot"> </a>
<h3>Pilot _NAMELINK(pilot)</h3>
<p>
    
</p>



<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            The first step to switching to the pilot based infrastructure
            is to make sure you have at least one working node configured
            with workspace-control, following the instructions in this
            guide as if you were not going to use dynamically allocated
            VMMs via the pilot.
        </p>

        <p>
            If the only nodes available are in the LRM pool, it would be best
            to drain the jobs from one and take it offline while you confirm
            the setup.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Next, make sure that the system account the container is
            running in can submit jobs to the LRM.  For example, run
            <b>echo "/bin/true" | qsub</b>
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Next, decide how you would like to organize the cluster nodes,
            such that the request for time on the nodes from the workspace
            service in fact makes it end up with usable VMM nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if there are only a portion of nodes configured
            with Xen and workspace-control, you can set up a special node
            property (e.g. 'xen') or perhaps a septe queue or server.
            The service supports submitting jobs with node property
            requirements and also supports the full Torque/PBS
            '[queue][@server]' destination syntax if desired.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Copy the
            "services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/other/<b>resource-locator-pilot.xml</b>"
            to
            "services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/other/<b>resource-locator-ACTIVE.xml</b>"
        </p>

        <p>
            The configuration comments in "services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/<b>pilot.conf</b>"
            should be self explanatory.  There are a few to highlight here
            (and note that advanced configs are in <b>resource-locator-ACTIVE.xml</b>).
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    HTTP digest access authentication based notifications
                    is a mechanism for pilot notifications.  Each message
                    from a pilot process to the workspace service takes
                    on the order of 10ms on our current testbed which is
                    reasonable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <b>contactPort</b> setting is used
                    to control what port the embedded HTTP server listens
                    on.  It is also the contact URL passed to the pilot
                    program, an easy way to get this right is to use an
                    IP address rather than a hostname.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note the <b>accountsPath</b> setting.
                    Navigate to that file ("services/etc/nimbus/workspace_service/<b>pilot-authz.conf</b>"
                    by default) and change the shared secret to something
                    not dictionary based and 15 or more characters.
                    A script in that directory will produce suggestions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This port may be blocked off entirely from WAN access
                    via firewall if desired, only the pilot programs need
                    to connect to it.  If it is not blocked off, the use
                    of HTTP digest access authentication for connections
                    is still guarding access.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alternatively, you can configure only SSH for these
                    notifications as well as configure both and use SSH as
                    a fallback mechanism.
                    When used as a fallback mechanism, the pilot will try to
                    contact the HTTP server and if that fails will then
                    attempt to use SSH.  Those message are written to a
                    file and will be read when the workspace service
                    recovers.  This is an advanced configuration, setting
                    up the infrastructure without this configured is recommended
                    for the first pass (reduce your misconfiguration chances).
                </p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    The <b>maxMB</b> setting is used to
                    set a hard maximum memory allotment across all workspace
                    requests (no matter what the authorization layers
                    allow).  This a "fail fast" setting, making sure
                    dubious requests are not sent to the LRM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To arrive at that number, you must arrive at the
                    maximum amount of memory
                    to give domain 0 in non-hosting mode.  This should be
                    as much as possible and you will also configure this later
                    into the pilot program settings (the pilot will make sure domain
                    0 gets this memory back when returning the node from hosting
                    mode to normal job mode).
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the node boots and xend is first run, you should
                    configure things such that domain 0 is already at this
                    memory setting.  This way, it will be ready to give
                    jobs as many resources as possible from its initial
                    boot state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Domain 0's memory is set in the boot pmeters.
                    On the "kernel" line you can add a parameter like this:
                    <b>dom0_mem=2007M</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If it is too high you will make the node unbootable,
                    2007M is an example from a 2048M node and was arrived
                    at experimentally.  We are working on ways to
                    automatically figure out the highest number
                    this can be without causing boot issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take this setting and subtract at least 128M from it,
                    allocating the rest for guest workspaces.  Let's label
                    128M in this example as <b>dom0-min</b>
                    and 2007 as <b>dom0-max</b>.  Some memory
                    is necessary for domain 0 to at least do privileged
                    disk and net I/O for guest domains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These two memory setting will be configured into the
                    pilot to make sure domain 0 is always in the correct
                    state.  Domain 0's memory will never be set below the
                    <b>dom0-min</b> setting and will always
                    be returned to the <b>dom0-max</b> when
                    the pilot program vacates the node.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of letting the workspace request fail on the
                    backend just before instantiation, the
                    <b>maxMB</b> setting is configured in
                    the service so b requests for more memory will be
                    rejected up front.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So [ <b>dom0-max</b> minus
                    <b>dom0-min</b> equals
                    <b>maxMB</b> ].  And again
                    <b>maxMB</b> is the maximum allowed for
                    guest workspaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ( You could make it smaller.  But it would not make
                    sense to make it bigger than
                    [ <b>dom0-max</b> minus
                    <b>dom0-min</b> ] because this will
                    cause the pilot program itself to reject the request. )
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    The <b>pilotPath</b> setting must be
                    gotten right and double checked.
                    See
                    <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5869">this
                    bugzilla item</a>
                </p>
            </li>

        </ul>

    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Next, note your pilotPath setting and put a copy of
            <b>workspacepilot.py</b> there. Run
            <b>chmod +x</b> on it and that is all
            that should be necessary for the installation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Python 2.3 or higher (though not Python 3.x) is also required
            but this was required for workspace-control as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            A sudo rule to the xm program is also required but this was
            configured when you set up workspace-control.  If the account
            the pilot jobs are run under is different than the account that
            runs workspace-control, copy the xm sudo rule for the account.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Open the <b>workspacepilot.py</b> file in an
            editor.  These things must be configured correctly and require
            your intervention (i.e., the software cannot guess at them):
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li>
                Search for "<b>secret: pw_here</b>" around
                line 80.  Replace "pw_here" with the shared secret you
                configured above.
            </li>

            <li>
                Below that, set the "minmem" setting to the value you chose
                above that we called <b>dom0-min</b>.
            </li>

            <li>
                Set the "dom0_mem" setting to the value you chose above
                that we called <b>dom0-max</b>.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            The other configurations should be explained enough in the
            comments and they also usually do not need to be altered.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might like to create a directory for the pilot's logfiles
            instead
            of the default setting of "/tmp" for the "logfiledir"
            configuration.  You might also wish to septe out the config
            file from the program.  The easiest way to do that is
            to configure the service to call a shell script instead of
            workspacepiloy.py.  This in turn could wrap the call to the
            pilot program, for example:
            <b>"/opt/workspacepilot.py -p /etc/workspace-pilot.conf $@"</b>
        </p>

    </li>

    <li>
        Now restart the GT container and submit test workspace requests as
        usual (cloud requests work too).
    </li>

</ol>

<h2>Configuring a standalone context broker _NAMELINK(context-broker)</h2>

<p>
    The <a href="../faq.html#ctxbroker">context broker</a> is used to
    facilitate <a href="../clouds/clusters.html">one click clusters</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The context broker
    is installed and configured automatically starting with Nimbus 2.4, but there
    is not a dependency on any Nimbus service component.  It can run by itself in a
    GT container.  You can use it for deploying virtual clusters on EC2 for
    example without any other Nimbus service running (the cloud client #11 has
    an "ec2script" option that will allow you to do this).
</p>
<p>
    If you want to install the broker separately from Nimbus, download the 
    Nimbus source tarball, extract it, and run 
    <i>scripts/broker-build-and-install.sh</i> with an appropriate 
    <b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION</b> set.
</p>
<p>
    To set up a standalone broker that is compatible with post-010 cloud clients,
    follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Create a passwordless CA certificate.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can do this from an existing CA.  To unencrypt an RSA key, run:
            <i>openssl rsa -in cakey.pem -out cakey-unencrypted.pem</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, you can use the CA created by the Nimbus installer
            under $NIMBUS_HOME/var/ca
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Make very sure that the CA certificate and key files are read-only
            and private to the container running account.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Add the CA certificate to your container's trusted certificates
            directory.  The context broker (running in the container) creates
            short term credentials on the fly for the VMs.  The VMs use this
            to contact the broker: the container needs to be able to verify
            who is calling.

<h2>Cumulus _NAMELINK(cumulus)</h2>
<p>
    <a href="../faq.html#cumulus">Cumulus</a> is the S3 compliant repository 
    management service for Nimbus.
</p>
<p>
Cumulus is an open source implementation of the Amazon S3 REST API.  It
is packaged with the Nimbus
however it can be used without nimbus as well.  Cumulus allows
you to server files to users via a known and adopted REST API. Your
clients will be able to access your data service with the
Amazon S3 clients they already use.

</p>

<a name="cumulus-config"> </a>
<h3>Cumulus Configuration _NAMELINK(cumulus-config)</h3>
<p>
When the Cumulus server is run it expects to find a configuration file (typically
called cumulus.ini) in one or all of the following locations:
</p>
    <ol>
        <li>/etc/nimbus/cumulus.ini</li>
        <li>~/.nimbus/cumulus.ini</li>
        <li>the same directory from which the program was launched</li>
        <li>file pointed to by the environment variable CUMULUS_SETTINGS_FILE</li>
    </ol>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title">cumulus.ini in Nimbus</p>
For Nimbus installations this file can be found at
<tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/cumulus/etc/cumulus.ini</tt>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Each file in the path is read in (provided it exists).  The values found 
in each file override the values found in the previous file in this list.

</p>


<a name="repository-location"> </a>
<h3>Repository Location _NAMELINK(repository-location)</h3>
<p>
The backend storage system in Cumulus has been created with a modular 
interface that will allow us to add more
sophisticated plugins in the future.  Thus giving the administrator 
many powerful options.
In the current implementation there is a single storage module which stores 
user files a mounted file system.  
The reliability and performance of Cumulus will thus be
limited by the reliability and performance of that file system.  Because
of this Cumulus administrators will often want to specify a location for
the repository.
</p>
<p>
Within the cumulus.ini file there is the [posix]:directory directive.
This is the directory in which all of the files in the Cumulus repository
will be stored.  The names of the files in that directory will be
obfuscated based on the bucket/key name.  In order to discover what file
belongs to what bucket/key you must use the user management tools (included
with the Cumulus installation)
There are a series of tools under the bin
directory which start with nimbusauthz-* that can help with this.  In most
cases there will be no need for a system administrator to use these
tools and they are provided for expert usage for problematic situations.

<h3>Using the boto client _NAMELINK(boto)</h3>
<p>
To use boto it is important to disable virtual host based buckets and
to point the client at the right server.  here is example code that
will instantiate a boto S3Connection for use with CB:
</p>
<pre class="panel">
    cf = OrdinaryCallingFormat()
    hostname = "somehost.com"
    conn = S3Connection(id, pw, host=hostname, port=80, is_secure=False, calling_format=cf)
</pre>

<a name="s3cmd"> </a>
<h3>Using the s3cmd client _NAMELINK(s3cmd)</h3>
<p>
Once you have the s3cmd successfully installed and configured you must
modify the file: $HOME/.s3cfg in order to direct it at this server.
Make sure the following key value pairs reflect the following changes:
</p>
<pre class="panel">
    access_key = &lt;access id&gt;
    secret_key = &lt;access secret&gt;
    host_base = &lt;hostname of service&gt;
    host_bucket = &lt;hostname of server&gt;
    use_https = False
</pre>
<a name="cumulus-https"> </a>
<h3>Using HTTPS with Cumulus _NAMELINK(cumulus-https)</h3>
<p>
In order to use a secure https connection with cumulus you must edit the 
cumulus.ini file and provide it with a certificate and key pair.  In
a typical nimbus installation these are generated for you and placed at:

<tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/var/hostcert.pem</tt>
<tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/var/hostkey.pem</tt>

To add them to the cumulus.ini file add the following lines:
<pre class="panel">
[https]
enabled=True
key=/home/nimbus/var/hostkey.pem
cert=/home/nimbus/var/hostcert.pem
</pre>

<a name="cumulus-quotas"> </a>
<h3>Disk Usage Quotas _NAMELINK(cumulus-quotas)</h3>
<p>
Cumulus allows administrators to set disk space limits on a per user basis.
By default users are created with unlimited space.  To set a disk quota 
limit use the program <tt class="literal">NIMBUS_HOME/ve/bin/cumulus-quota</tt>
Here is an example that will set the user user1@nimbusproject.org to a 
100 byte limit:
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ ./ve/bin/cumulus-quota user1@nimbusproject.org 100
$ ./ve/bin/cumulus-list-users user1@nimbusproject.org
friendly        : user1@nimbusproject.org
ID              : Ar2yXcfdhImjMNeWGUHJZ
password        : ddOWFSC5rol9L6Tk14hA0QeS7valQdy38xeVvkFZwq
quota           : 100
canonical id    : 21161ebe-862a-11df-a9ca-001de0a80259
</pre>

<h3>Configuring Cumulus Options in Nimbus _NAMELINK(cumulusnimbusconfig)</h3>

<p>

There are a few variables that Nimbus relies on to find information 
about its co-located Cumulus server.  These variables are found in
the file: 
<tt class="literal">./services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/cumulus.conf</tt>.
They are normally written automatically by the nimbus-configure program 
but if an administrator makes some manual changes to their Nimbus installation
some of these variables may been to be changed as well.

<ul>
    <li><tt class="literal">cumulus.authz.db</tt></li>
    The cumulus authz database.  By default it is an sqlite database and
    is located at $NIMBUS_HOME/cumulus/etc/authz.db

    <li><tt class="literal">cumulus.repo.dir</tt></li>
    The location of the cumulus posix backend file repository.  By default
    this is $NIMBUS_HOME/cumulus/posixdata.  Quite often users will want
    to change this to a more favorable location.  Likely one with more
    disk space or faster disks.

    <li><tt class="literal">cumulus.repo.bucket</tt></li>
    The cumulus bucket in which all cloud client images are stored.

    <li><tt class="literal">cumulus.repo.prefix</tt></li>
    The prefix iwith which all image names are prepended.

</ul>
