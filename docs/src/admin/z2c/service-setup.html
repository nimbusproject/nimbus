<h2>Service Installation</h2>

<p>
    On this page, you will install the Nimbus central services and
    image repository (<i>Cumulus</i>), and use a cloud
    client to access your cloud as a remote client.
</p>
<p>
    This will however only work in "fake mode" which means that the
    service is only pretending to start VMs.  In later steps you will
    enable VMMs, connect them with the central service, and have a
    working cloud setup.
</p>


<h3>Create nimbus user</h3>
<p>
    The first step is to create a separate unix account under which to
    install and run the Nimbus services. It is not recommended to use
    the root account. Because you will later be configuring password-less
    SSH keys between this account and your hypervisor nodes, it is best
    to use a dedicated account for these services.
</p>
<p>
    In this guide, we will be calling the user
    <tt class="literal">nimbus</tt>, but you can use anything you like.
</p>


<h3>Download and install</h3>
<p>
    As the new <tt class="literal">nimbus</tt> user, fetch and unpack
    the latest service distribution.
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ wget http://www.nimbusproject.org/downloads/nimbus-2.5-src.tar.gz
</pre>
<pre class="panel">
$ tar xfz nimbus-2.5-src.tar.gz
</pre>
<pre class="panel">
$ cd nimbus-2.5-src/
</pre>

<p>
    You must now choose an installation directory. It could be within
    the <tt class="literal">nimbus</tt> user home directory, or something
    like /opt/nimbus. If the directory exists, it must be empty and writable.
    If it does not exist, the parent directory must be writable.
</p>

<p>
    Throughout this guide, we will refer to this installation directory as
    <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME</tt>. To install, run this command from
    the Nimbus source directory (specifying your chosen destination).
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ ./install $NIMBUS_HOME
</pre>

<div class="note">
    <p class="note-title">Service ports</p>
    <p>
        If you need to specify a non default Python, you can do so by setting the
        <tt class="literal">PYTHON</tt> environment variable. For example if you
        are using RHEL5 and cannot upgrade the system Python to 2.5+, you can
        install Python separately and specify
        <tt class="literal">PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python2.5</tt> for installation.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    The installer performs several steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Installs Cumulus and dependencies to a Python
        <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>
    </li>
    <li>Builds and installs Nimbus services</li>
    <li>Creates initial databases</li>
    <li>Runs interactive configuration program to gather basic information</li>
    <li>Generates internal Certificate Authority for host certificates</li>
</ul>

<p>
    After the install completes, you should have a Nimbus system set up with
    security, web services, and sensible configuration defaults. However the
    service is running in "fake" mode, where no VMs are actually started. This
    is a great opportunity to test the service and Cumulus installs before we
    move on to VMM and network setup.
</p>
<div class="note">
    <p class="note-title">Service ports</p>
    <p>
        Nimbus requires several network ports. We have chosen some sensible defaults,
        but you may adjust them if needed. The initial default set is:
        <UL>
            <LI>Cumulus : 8888</LI>
            <LI>Nimbus Service interface : 8443</LI>This is used by the cloud-client
            <LI>EC2 compatible REST Interface: 8444</LI>
        </UL>

    </p>
    <B>Changing the Cumulus port</b>
    <p>
        The configuration options for Cumulus can be found in 
        $HOME/.nimbus/cumulus.ini.  Under the heading [cb] there is a port =
        entry.  Change that value and restart Cumulus with the <i>nimbusctl</i>
        program.
        <pre>
[cb]

installdir = &lt;nimbus home&gt;
port = 8888
hostname = &lt;hostname&gt;
        </pre>

        <i>note:</i>
        If this change is made after you have distributed a cloud.properties
        file to users then you will need to instruct your cloud-client users
        to change the value vws.repository=<hostname>:<port> in their local
        cloud.properties file.

    </p>
</div>


<h3>Start services</h3>
<p>
    Now that the services are installed, you can try to start them for the first
    time. First, change to the installation directory and take a look at what is
    in the <tt class="literal">bin/</tt> directory.  
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ cd $NIMBUS_HOME
</pre>
<pre class="panel">
$ ls bin/
nimbus-configure	nimbus-new-cert		nimbusctl
nimbus-edit-user	nimbus-new-user
nimbus-list-users	nimbus-remove-user
</pre>

<p>
    There are several useful commands available which we will get to in time, but
    for now we want to use the <tt class="literal">nimbusctl</tt> command to start
    the Nimbus services.
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/nimbusctl start
Launching Nimbus services...   OK
Launching Cumulus services...  OK
</pre>

<p>
    If one or both services fail to start, you should take a look at the appropriate
    log file. For Nimbus services, check <tt class="literal">var/services.log</tt>.
    For Cumulus, look in <tt class="literal">cumulus/log/cumulus.log</tt>.
</p>

<h3>Create first user</h3>
<p>
    Now that Nimbus is installed and running, we can move on to testing with a real
    client. But first, we need to create a user account to test with. We will do this
    with the <tt class="literal">nimbus-new-user</tt> tool. It has many options which
    you will want to explore later. But for now we should just use the defaults,
    specifying an email address to associate with the account as well as a temporary
    directory in which to place credentials.
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/nimbus-new-user -d /tmp/newuser someone@someplace.com

cert            : /tmp/newuser/usercert.pem
key             : /tmp/newuser/userkey.pem
dn              : /O=Auto/OU=97e51165-cdb4-4376-b2ed-146f0cf67fbe/CN=someone@someplace.com
canonical id    : d5170810-85f8-11df-86fa-001641156eb6
access id       : pig5Rexcj6uFQBH3exGM5
access secret   : uQA6LqXSVNFwubQ505II1kqeLMEsEXGd1oXGNjwp0G
url             : None
web id          : None
cloud properties : /tmp/newuser/cloud.properties
</pre>
<p>
    The script outputs a lot of information about the new user, but you only need the
    files generated to your specified output directory. Hold on to these files, you
    will need them momentarily, after you install the cloud client.
</p>


<h3>Install cloud client and credentials</h3>
<p>
    We will test our services using the Nimbus cloud client. You can do so from the same
    system you are installing on, but you may want to use a separate system so you can
    verify that networking is working correctly. Grab the latest cloud client from the
    Nimbus <a href="http://www.nimbusproject.org/downloads/">downloads page</a>
    (version must be >= 16).
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ wget http://www.nimbusproject.org/downloads/nimbus-cloud-client-016.tar.gz
</pre>
<pre class="panel">
$ tar xfz nimbus-cloud-client-016.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>
    Now you need to install the files produced earlier by
    <tt class="literal">nimbus-new-user</tt>. The <tt class="literal">cloud.properties</tt>
    file needs to be placed into the extracted cloud client's <tt class="literal">conf/</tt>
    directory. The <tt class="literal">usercert.pem</tt> and
    <tt class="literal">userkey.pem</tt> files need to be installed into
    <tt class="literal">~/.globus/</tt> in your home directory. Be careful not to overwrite
    any credentials you already have in <tt class="literal">~/.globus/</tt>.
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ cp newuser/cloud.properties nimbus-cloud-client-016/conf/
</pre>
<pre class="panel">
$ mkdir ~/.globus/
</pre>
<pre class="panel">
$ cp newuser/*.pem ~/.globus/
</pre>
