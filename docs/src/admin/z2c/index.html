<h2>Nimbus 2.5RC2 Zero To Cloud Guide</h2>

<p>
    This "zero to cloud" guide contains configuration information for system 
    administrators working with Nimbus.
</p>

<p>
	This is the main way Nimbus is installed and if this is your first time
	installing it, it is highly recommended that you follow this process
	exactly.
</p>

<p>
    When you have finished the guide, you will have a working cloud configuration that serves remote users using the cloud-client, <a href="../../elclients.html">EC2 clients</a> such as boto, and <a href="../reference.html#s3cmd">S3 clients</a> such as s3cmd.
</p>

<p>
    If you are unfamiliar with the cloud client, it may be good to <a href="http://scienceclouds.org/clouds/">get access</a>
    to a working installation to try it out first, but it is not necessary.  You could also look over the <a href="../reference.html#cloud-overview">cloud overview</a> documentation to get context.
</p>

<p>
	The guide is broken up into different pages. As you make your way
	through, in sequence, you must complete each page's instructions.
	By the end of each page you will have been able to test your work such
	that you know you can move on.

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <a href="service-dependencies.html">Service Dependencies</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page, you will install any missing dependencies for the
            service node.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <a href="service-setup.html">Service Installation</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page, you will install the Nimbus central services and
            image repository (<i>Cumulus</i>), and use a cloud
            client to access your cloud as a remote client.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will however only work in "fake mode" which means that the
            service is only pretending to start VMs.  In later steps you will
            enable VMMs, connect them with the central service, and have a
            working cloud setup.
        </p>

            <a href="networking-setup.html">Install DHCPd and Configure Networking</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page, you will install a central DHCPd daemon (or
            integrate with an existing one) and configure the networking
            addresses you want to give out to virtual machines when they
            boot.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <a href="vmm-setup.html">Install VMM Software</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page, you will install the Nimbus VMM software
            (<i>workspace-control</i>) and any of its dependencies
            (including Xen or KVM as well as libvirt, if these are not present
            already).
        </p>
        <p>
            workspace-control contains scripts that will help you test that
            your Xen/KVM/libvirt installation will work with the programmatic
            access patterns that Nimbus uses.
        </p>

    <li>
        <p>
            <a href="ssh-setup.html">SSH Setup</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page, you will configure SSH on your cluster so that the
            Nimbus components can properly and securely communicate.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <a href="final-tests.html">Final Tests</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page, you will remotely test the system with the cloud
            client like you did before.  But this time, a virtual machine
            will be started for you as expected.
        </p>

            What Next?
        </p>
        <p>
            This part of the documentation is going to be expanded soon.  The short answer is that you can start enabling remote users.  You should familiarize yourself with the <a href="../reference.html#user-management">user management</a> tools, the <a href="../reference.html#nimbusweb-config">web application</a> that is available for securely distributing credentials, and look into configuring <a href="../reference.html#group-authz">per-user rights and allocations</a>.
