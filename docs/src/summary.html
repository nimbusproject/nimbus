<h2>Nimbus 2.5RC2 - Bird's Eye View</h2>

<p>
    If you want to learn more about the concepts underlying Nimbus, see the
    <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> and <a href="_NIMBUS_WEBSITE/papers/">Publications</a>
    section.
</p>

<p>
    In a nutshell,
    Nimbus allows a client to <b>lease remote resources</b> by deploying virtual
    machines (VMs) on those resources and configuring them to represent
    an environment desired by the user.  This is known casually as <i>cloud
    computing</i> (one definition of it), a little more specifically as an
    "infrastructure-as-a-service" (IaaS) solution.
</p>
<p>
    Also included in a Nimbus installation is a storage cloud
    implementation called Cumulus that has been tightly integrated with the
    other central services (but it can also be used standalone). Cumulus is
    compatible with the Amazon Web Services S3 REST API, but extends it as
    well (to include quota management, for example).
</p>
<p>
    A set of software needs to be installed to one <i>service node</i> in
    a non-root account and a separate piece of software needs to be 
    installed on any number of <i>virtual machine monitor</i> (VMM) nodes
    (some root permissions are required).
</p>
<p>
    There is also a separate download for a client called the <i>cloud
    client</i> that makes life very easy for users.
</p>
<p>
    Clients interact with the service using credentials over multiple
    protocols.  The easiest client to use is the <i>cloud client</i>
    (<a href="clouds/cloudquickstart.html">details</a>) which
    is geared towards getting users up and running in minutes.  The service
    must be configured in the <a href="admin/z2c/">cloud configuration</a>
    to serve requests from the cloud client.  These clients implement web
    services messaging (specifically
    <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsrf">WSRF</a> based).
</p>
<p>
    But Nimbus also provides an implementation of Amazon's Elastic
    Compute Cloud (EC2) that allows you to use clients developed for the real
    EC2 system against Nimbus based clouds.  See the <a href="elclients.html">EC2 Clients</a> page.
</p>
<p>
    You can examine the web services based interface details in the
    <a href="interfaces/index.html">WSRF interfaces</a> section.
</p>
<p>
    Nimbus also allows clients to create <b>auto-configuring clusters</b>.
    Starting one VM is somewhat straightforward, but launching 10s or 100s
    together can become laborious without heavily customized scripts.  Nimbus
    provides a general solution to this problem, one that allows you to even
    store VMs with no private credentials on-board.  For more information,
    see <a href="clouds/clusters.html#features">here</a>.
