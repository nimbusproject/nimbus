<h2>One Click Clusters</h2>

<div style="float: left; width: 80px;"><a href="clusters.html"><img src="img/network-receive-72.png" /></a></div>
<p>
  Quickstart and conceptual overview for launching one-click, auto-configuring clusters.
</p>
  
<p>
  If you are already running on one of the <a href="index.html">science
  clouds</a>, you could launch and use a cluster right this minute.  Or you
  could run your own cloud (the 
  <a href="http://workspace.globus.org/downloads/index.html">software</a>
  is free and open source).

<a name="background"> </a>
<h2>Background _NAMELINK(background)</h2>

<p>
  Using the "--cluster" option, the cloud client can direct the workspace
  service to launch any number (and any type) of workspaces simultaneously. 
  Something called the <i>context broker</i> will work behind the scenes to
  make sure each node has the information they need to play their various
  roles.
</p>
  
<p>
  You can bring up the exact cluster you need whenever necessary. It's portable
  across clouds, too.  If you need to make some updates you can re-launch from
  a new template image (that you already tested at small scale).  You can
  also customize files on a per launch basis to make the cluster have different
  policies or behaviors.  You can even direct the same image file to take on
  different roles depending on what the context broker tells it.
</p>


<div style="float: left; width: 56px;"><img src="img/note.png" /></div>
<p>
  No private keys need to live on the images in your cluster before
  they are booted.  This means you can freely collaborate on useful setups and
  distribute them openly over the internet to end users.
</p>

<br />

<a name="exampleoverview"></a>

<h2>Example _NAMELINK(exampleoverview)</h2>

<p>
  If you have access to a science cloud and see the 'base-cluster-01.gz' image
  in your personal repository directory, you can launch the cluster yourself.
  You will need a <a href="cloudquickstart.html#install">cloud client</a>
  009 or later.
</p>

<p>
There are four steps to the example:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Edit the access policy to install on the cluster (dictate the grid-mapfile contents)</li>
  <li>Run one command to launch the cluster</li>
  <li>Run one scp command to get the cluster's auto-created
  credential so local job submission tools can trust it </li>
  <li>Export an environment variable that will point tools to the credential directory</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Now you can submit remote work: you have a Torque PBS cluster
  fronted by GridFTP and GRAM.
</p>

<p>
  Steps #1, #3, and #4 are particular to the example cluster, to configure
  security settings for GridFTP and GRAM.
</p>

<p class="indent1em">
  <div style="float: left; width: 56px;"><img src="img/note.png" /></div>
<p>
  SSH trust is already setup for you as part of #2. The nodes have been
  configured to trust your SSH key for logins.  You trust each nodes' generated
  SSH host keys.
</p>

<br />

<a name="examplequick"> </a>

<h2>Super-quick start _NAMELINK(examplequick)</h2>

<p>
  The guide on this page below contains inline explanation of the commands
  and what's happening.  But if you'd just like to get going with the sample,
  here is what you need to do:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Edit <b><i>samples/base-cluster.xml</i></b> to include your DN in the gridmap field</li>
  <li>Run <b><i>./bin/cloud-client.sh --run --hours 1 --cluster samples/base-cluster.xml</i></b></li>
  <li>Wait a few minutes</li>
  <li>At exit, note the hostname printed for "[[ head-node ]]"</li>
  <li>Configure local tools to trust the cluster:<br/>
  <div style="margin-left: 15px;"><b><i>scp -r root@HEADNODE-HOSTNAME:certs/* &nbsp;lib/certs/</i></b><br />
  <b><i>export X509_CERT_DIR=`pwd`/lib/certs</i></b></div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  There is a full sample of commands and output <a href="cluster-all-output.txt">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Now you can send work.  You have your very own, working:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Torque installation for distributing work across the cluster</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.globus.org/grid_software/computation/gram.php">GRAM4</a> (backed by Torque) installation at <i>"https://HEADNODE_HOSTNAME:8443/wsrf/services/ManagedJobFactoryService"</i></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/data/gridftp/">GridFTP</a> server on standard port 2811 of the headnode</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.globus.org/grid_software/data/rft.php">RFT</a> service at <i>"https://HEADNODE_HOSTNAME:8443/wsrf/services/ReliableFileTransferFactoryService"</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
Some notes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any user account (including root) can freely SSH across the cluster to corresponding account</li>
  <li>The "/home" directory is mounted from headnode to each compute over NFS</li>
  <li>You should map your DN to the 'jobrun' account (like the sample value in base-cluster.xml)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  To make your image(s) auto-configure your own software choices, see
  <i><a href="clusters2.html#custom">How do I make images of my own do 
  this?</a></i>.  While this will take more than "one click" to set up, our
  alpha users have had successes in short order.  You can run and
  auto-configure pretty much any type of software/application that will run 
  on a normal cluster.
</p>

<h2>Example walkthrough _NAMELINK(examplewalk)</h2>

<p>
  We assume, like with single VM launches you've done, you have run
  grid-proxy-init.  See the main <a href="index.html">clouds page</a> for
  more information.
</p>

<p>
  We've put a full sample of commands and output <a href="cluster-all-output.txt">here</a> for reference.
  What follows is a walkthrough of everything that happens.
</p>

<a name="gridmapedit"> </a>
<h4>* Configure the grid-mapfile contents you want: _NAMELINK(gridmapedit)</h4>
<br />
<p>
  Edit <i>samples/base-cluster.xml</i>, find the "&lt;data name="gridmap"&gt;"
  tag and add your DN.  This cluster has a generic account called "jobrun" you
  can map to (follow the example).
</p>
<p>
  Notice we are requesting one head node and two compute nodes.  This
  particular cluster can launch with only one head node but any number of
  compute nodes.
</p>

<a name="clusterlaunch"> </a>
<h4>* Launch the cluster: _NAMELINK(clusterlaunch)</h4>

<br />
        
<p>Now you can launch:</p>

_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
./bin/cloud-client.sh --run --hours 1 --cluster samples/base-cluster.xml
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<p>
  Some information is printed (including the assigned IP addresses), just
  like with single launches.  We quickly move to this output:
</p>
  
<div class="screen"><pre>Launching cluster-001... done.

Waiting for launch updates.</pre>
</div>

<p>
  This is the first of two waiting periods, this is when the images files make
  their way to the hypervisors and it will take a few minutes.  The next
  waiting period is much shorter.
</p>

<div style="float: left; width: 56px;"><img src="img/note.png" /></div>
<p>
  While you're waiting, make a mental note of the handle.  This will look
  something like "cluster-001".  This is just like "vm-001" for non-cluster
  launches, you can use it to manage things, for example terminate
  (<i>"./bin/cloud-client.sh --terminate --handle cluster-001"</i>)
</p>

<a name="launched"> </a>
<h4>* Launched: _NAMELINK(launched)</h4>

<br />
        
<p>
  Information starts to come in:
</p>
<div class="screen"><pre>
  - cluster-001: all members are Running
  - wrote reports to '/tmp/cloud-client/history/cluster-001/reports-vm'</pre>
</div>
<p>
  Everything is now "Running" which really means the VMs are all at least
  <b>booting</b>.  If there was a problem, an error notice would
  print to the screen and the "reports-vm" directory that is listed here would
  have all the details on any errors.
</p>
<p>
  Information is archived in that directory for successes, too, but you
  typically only need the hostname to log into or submit jobs to.  That
  hostname is printed to the screen and also always available by looking at
  your <i>history/cluster-001/run-log.txt</i> file.
</p>

<a name="ctxstatus"> </a>
<h4>* Contextualization status: _NAMELINK(ctxstatus)</h4>

<br />
        
<p>
  Next up, we wait for contextualization.  Shown here is the waiting message
  along with the result.  It takes much less time than the previous wait.
</p>

<div class="screen"><pre>
Waiting for context broker updates.
  - cluster-001: contextualized
  - wrote ctx summary to '/tmp/cloud-client/history/cluster-001/reports-ctx/CTX-OK.txt'
  - wrote reports to '/tmp/cloud-client/history/cluster-001/reports-ctx'</pre>
</div>

<p>What 'contextualized" means is that every node has:</p>
<ul>
  <li>gotten in contact with the context broker</li>
  <li>provided data to the context broker, e.g. SSH public key</li>
  <li>gotten all necessary information from the context broker</li>
  <li>successfully called the just-in-time configuration scripts</li>
  <li>reported back to context broker that no error occured (ready to go)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Contextualization reports are available at the listed reports directory but
  like the launch reports, you don't really need to pay attention unless there
  was an error.  If there is an error, the error reports are written to the
  reports directory and the cluster is backed out.  These error reports 
  include all logs of each context agent (all output leading up to the 
  problem, non-errors included too).
</p>

<a name="secgap"> </a>
<h4>* No security gap with SSH logins: _NAMELINK(secgap)</h4>

<br />
        
<p>
  The last thing you will see before the client exits:
</p>

<div class="screen"><pre>SSH trusts new key for hostname1.cloudurl.edu  [[ head-node ]]
SSH trusts new key for hostname2.cloudurl.edu  [[ compute-nodes #0 ]]
SSH trusts new key for hostname3.cloudurl.edu  [[ compute-nodes #1 ]]</pre>
</div>

<p>
  That final SSH message means that the client retrieved the SSH
  public keys from the context broker -- they are installed already to your
  local known_hosts file.  Which mean you can take an address and log in as
  <b>root</b>:
</p>

_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
ssh root@hostname1.cloudurl.edu
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<p>
  ... and you do not get <i>"The authenticity of host 'xyz (1.2.3.4)' can't be
  established"</i> messages anymore. 
</p>

<div style="float: left; width: 56px;"><img src="img/note.png" /></div>
<p>
  This relieves you of that pesky 'y' keystroke to accept the key -- and no
  more "WARNING KEY HAS CHANGED" messages when you've been given an IP that's
  been seen before.  But this <b>importantly means the gap is closed on
  possible man-in-the-middle attacks</b>.  Through secure channels end to end,
  the client is able to know the public key that each instance generated at
  boot.
</p>

<div style="float: left; width: 56px;"><img src="img/note.png" /></div>
<p>
  You can turn off this
  auto-configuration of your known_hosts file by removing the "ssh.hostsfile"
  configuration from the <i>conf/cloud.properties</i> file.
  Also, to support large virtual clusters, there is an option to only get this
  SSH adjustment for specific nodes you care about logging in to directly.  
  For example, you may have 100
  compute nodes on a NAT'd network behind the edge nodes.  You wouldn't care
  about known_hosts adjustment for those so you can turn that off on a case
  by case basis.
</p>

<a name="trustconfig"> </a>
<h4>* Configure grid tools trust: _NAMELINK(trustconfig)</h4>

<br />
        
<p>
  Before submitting to the cluster, we need the grid tools to trust the
  middleware on the headnode.
  The head node has been configured to create a self-signed host certificate. 
  Grab it and add it to the embedded trusted cert directory like this:
</p>

_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
scp -r root@hostname1.cloudurl.edu:certs/* &nbsp;lib/certs/
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<p>
  Make grid tools trust that host certificate:
</p>

_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
export X509_CERT_DIR=`pwd`/lib/certs
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<br />
        
<a name="endresult"> </a>
<h4>* Result: _NAMELINK(endresult)</h4>

<br />
        
<p>
You now have your own, working:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Torque installation for distributing work across the cluster</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.globus.org/grid_software/computation/gram.php">GRAM4</a> (backed by Torque) installation at <i>"https://HEADNODE_HOSTNAME:8443/wsrf/services/ManagedJobFactoryService"</i></li>
