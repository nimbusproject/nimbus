## SUBNETS ##

# Make an entry like this for each supported subnet.  Otherwise, the DHCP
# daemon will not listen for requests on the interface of that subnet.

subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
}

subnet 172.16.65.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
}


# For multiple networks off the same (local) interface, comment out the
# above and use the following construct:

#shared-network networks_ether1 {
#
#  subnet 10.135.125.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
#  }
#
#  subnet 172.22.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 {
#  }
#}

# Most DHCP servers will require an actual IP presence on these other
# networks.
#
# For example, consider the local eth0 has this address: 10.135.125.17.
# To support the other network 172.22.0.0/16, make an eth0 interface alias
# like this:  "ip link set veth1 name eth0:0".
#
# Then assign it an IP on the other network, for example:
# "ifconfig eth0:0 172.22.0.1 netmask 255.255.0.0"
# Note this IP cannot be one that is leased to a VM in the workspace
# service network pool configurations.
