# What hypervisor is libvirt talking to?
# Valid choices:
#   "xen3" - http://libvirt.org/drvxen.html
#   "kvm0" - http://libvirt.org/drvqemu.html
#   "mock" - http://libvirt.org/drvtest.html (this does nothing)

vmm: xen3

# New as of Nimbus IaaS 2.8
# Config can be missing, will default to "destroy"
# The historical behavior of Nimbus is to gracefully shutdown an instance
# if it is going to be unpropagated back, otherwise it is a hard destroy.
# The following setting will override the behavior of workspace-control and
# actually attempt to gracefully shutdown the instance before destroying it. 
# This allows the node's kernel to cleanly shut things down like TCP
# connections.  Use "destroy" for the traditional behavior (the default
# configuration) and use "shutdown" to trigger shutdown + destroy. 

destroy_method: destroy

# New as of Nimbus IaaS 2.8
# Config can be missing if destroy_method is destroy.
# If using "shutdown" for "destroy_method", the following configuration will
# control how much time is allowed before the graceful shutdown is abandoned.
# The current implementation will wait the full grace period in all cases,
# so set to something low like 5 seconds.
# In seconds.  Using < 1 is illegal.

shutdown_grace: 5


[libvirt_connections]

# You should be able to connect using the "virsh" tool with these strings.
# For example, if you are using 'xen3' and the value here is "xen+unix:///" you
# should test a command like "virsh -c xen+unix:///"
#
# See the libvirt documentation and adjust this connection string for your
# particular situation.  You cannot use workspace-control if that command
# does not work from the *non-root* account that workspace-control runs as.
#
# To further complicate things, a non-root user can be configured to be a
# read-only user (able to run virsh commands such as 'list') but the account
# that runs workspace-control needs to be a read/write user (able to run
# virsh commands such as 'create' and 'destroy').
#
# The workspace-control tool uses a more direct connection to libvirt but if
# the virsh tool is working with the connection string configured here then
# that should mean workspace-control will as well.
#
# Both the read and write permissions can be tested using the 'sbin' scripts
# that the zero to cloud guide will have you use.

xen3: xen+unix:///
kvm0: qemu:///system

# Libvirt troubleshooting:
#
# If you are using "qemu:///system" or "xen+unix:///" and getting something
# like:
#
#   unable to connect to '/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock'
#
# ... then libvirtd is not running or there is a permissions problem on the
# unix domain socket.  See /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf for information about
# socket permissions and restart with "/etc/init.d/libvirtd"
#
