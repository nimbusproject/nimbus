Cumulus Quickstart
==================

1) Install the software:

    % ./install.sh <path to installation location>

Optionally you may provide a path where the software will be installed.  If
no path is provided the source directory is used.

2) Inspect the configuration settings in ~/.nimbus/cumulus.ini

3) Change to the install directory and start the server

    % ./bin/cumulus.sh

This will start the cumulus server with the options in ~/.nimbus/cumulus.ini

4) Create a new user

    % ./cumulus-add-user.sh <email address or display name>
    ID              : eqe0YoRAs2GT1sDvPZKAU
    password        : S9Ii7QqcCQxDecrezMn6o5frSFvXhThYWmCE4S7nAf
    quota           : None
    canonical_id    : 048db304-6b4c-11df-897b-001de0a80259

Remember the ID and Key.  The rest of the information can be ignored.

5) Configure s3cmd.  s3cmd is a popular third party S3 client that can
be used against cumulus.

    % cp ~/.s3cfg ~/.s3cfg.backup
    % cp dot_s3cfg ~/.s3cfg

Now add your key and ID to ~/.s3cfg.  Open the file and search for @@ID@@
and @@KEY@@.  Replace those strings with the appropriate values.

6) Try some s3cmd operations

    % s3cmd mb s3://TEST
    % s3cmd put /etc/group s3://TEST/group
    % s3cmd ls s3://TEST/
    
7) Run the tests

    % cd tests
    % ./run-all.sh

This will produce a lot of output.  When it is complete the last line should
indicate it was successful by displaying:

Success :  tests passed

If anything else is seen last it indicates that tests failed.
