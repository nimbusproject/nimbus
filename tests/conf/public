# A sample network pool 'public'

# The first non-blank, non-comment line must be the DNS server you would
# like to tell the VMs receiving addresses from this network pool to use.

# DNS server IP address (or 'none')
192.168.0.1

# The rest of the file's non-blank, non-comment lines are the addresses
# that will be leased out to VMs requesting this network.

# The only optional field is the MAC address. All others must be a valid
# entry or 'none'.

# The IP address and hostname fields may not be 'none'.
# If the gateway is 'none', no gateway is assigned.
# If broadcast or subnetmask are 'none' they are derived from the IP
#   - based on the normal subnet and broadcast for the IP class (A,B,C)

# An explicit MAC address may be optionally specified for an entry. The
# MAC must be specified as six pairs of hex digits, separated by colons.
# If you do not specify a MAC, one will be automatically generated when
# Nimbus is started.

# A file containing sample DHCP entries is written by the Nimbus service
# to $NIMBUS_HOME/services/var/nimbus/dhcpd.entries
# This file contains the generated and explicit IP -> MAC mappings and
# can be included in your site DHCPD configuration. There is also a
# simple text mapping of IP -> MAC written to the ip_mac.txt file in the
# same directory.
