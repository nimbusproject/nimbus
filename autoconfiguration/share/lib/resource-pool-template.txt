# NOTE: a node may not be in more than one pool at the same time, this will
#       result in an initialization error

# Supported form:
# node_name  memory_to_manage networks_supported
#
# If third field is blank (or marked with '*'), it is assumed that pool
# node supports all networks available to remote clients.  Otherwise use a comma
# separated list (no spaces between).
#
# Note that if you list a network here that is not valid at runtime,
# it will silently be ignored (check your spelling).
